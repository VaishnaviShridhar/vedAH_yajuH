The Baudhayana Śrautasûtra together with an English translation is being presented here in four volumes. There will be other volumes also presenting Bhavasvamin&rsquo;s bhāṣya and the word-index of the sutra-text. The Baudhayana Śrautasutra belongs to the Krsna Yajurveda Taittiriya recension. It represents the oral lectures delivered by the teacher Baudhāyana, hence is the oldest śrauta-text. The text is revised here in the light of the variant readings recorded by W. Caland in his first edition (Calcutta 1906), and is presented in a readable form. The mantras forming part of the sutras have been fully rendered into English. The translation is supplied with notes giving reference to the mantras and explanations of the ritual. The work is expected to serve as an advancement of Taittiriya ritualistic studies.

PREFACE
I am extermely happy to present to the world of scholars the text of the Baudhāyana Śrautasutra together with an English translation and notes. The first critical edition of this Śrautasūtra was prepared by W. Caland and was published in three volumes by the Asiatic Society of Bengal, Calcutta (1904-13). Its second edition-a reprint-was published at New Delhi in 1982. My translation is of course based on Caland&rsquo;s edition. A faithful translation of any ancient text, particularly a Vedic text, involves a thorough understanding of the text. Consequently I have paid close attention to the rich treasure of variant readings recorded by Caland in his Foot- notes. As a result of my close study of the text in all aspects and the numerous variant readings, I have improved the text at numerous places. Sometimes I have had to resort to emendation of certain readings. In my notes to the translation I have noted all such places where I have chosen a reading different from that of Caland&rsquo;s printed text. The text printed herein is thus, the Baudhāyana Śrautasûtra text in a revised form. I have excluded the Śulbasūtra (Praśna XXX) and the Pravarapraśna for reasons mentioned in the Introduction.
A new critical edition of the Baudhayana Śrautasūtra needs to be undertaken. Caland had utilised a number of manuscripts of the text for his edition. He has, however, left numerous doubtful places, particularly in Praśnas X-XIX. The Mackenzie Collection manuscript No. xxviii (new number 92), a Descriptive Cata- logue of the Oriental MSS collected by Lt. Col. Mackenzieedited by H.H. Wilson Vol. I. p.6 rendered him valuable help in defining the text and also the order of the text. Numerous textual difficulties still exist, and these require to be solved. Many more manuscripts of the Baudhayana Śrautasutra which were not available to Caland have fortunately been discovered and stored in manuscript-libraries. These manuscripts are indeed a great treasure which needs to be exploited. One may perhaps find among them manuscripts representing the tradition of Mackenzie manuscripts or even a better preserved tradition. The study of Śrautasūtras is far advanced since Caland published his edition. Consequently a new critical edition undertaken by an expert brain will be welcome. Since the text presented herein is only a revision of Caland&rsquo;s text, I have not found it necessary to reproduce the variant readings recorded by Caland in his Footnotes.
The Vedic texts by their very nature were not fully comprehensible by themselves to a student of literature and religion. Hence, the various means like the Bhāṣyas, Tīkās, Paddhatis and Prayogas came to be produced from time to time. The old commentators among them were rather brief because in their view only a few hints were sufficient for the elucidation of the text in hand. The later
vi
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA
commentators, on the other hand, wrote in rather a liberal manner because they thought the reader of their time was in need of detailed explanations. In modern times when modern dialects have become the vehicle of all communication and when visions of understanding have considerably widened, it became imperative to explain all old texts, particularly the Vedic, through translation and notes in modern languages.
Many of the Kalpasūtras have been translated into English, German, Dutch, French and other languages. The Baudhāyana Śrautasutra holds a prominent position among the Kalpasūtras for various reasons. It is extensive and dilates upon the sacrificial religion in a comprehensive manner. Full understanding of this text is essential for the scientific knowledge of the Vedic religion and culture. No complete translation of this significant text has been attempted so far in any language. Some portions of it have been rendered into English in detached manner in the various parts of the Śrautakosa published by the Vaidika Samshodhana
Mandala at Pune. Herein the mantras have not been translated. Yasuke Ikari has translated in English the tenth chapter of this text laying down the piling up of the Fire-altar (Agnicayana) in the Volume of Agni (Berkley, 1983) again without the translation of the mantras.
A complete English translation of the Baudhāyana Śrautasutra was therefore a desideratum, and it is my privilege to fill in the gap. In my translation I have mostly translated the mantra side by side with the injunctive part of a sutra. The Taittirīya- texts comprise both the mantra-portions and the Brāhmaṇa-portions. There is definite correlation between the mantra and the Brahmana. One cannot be fully understood without the other. This is true of the prose formulas and also of the verses. Such verses as are common to the Rgveda may bear loose relation to the ritual. I have not translated the Puronuvākyā and Yājyā verses which may hardly be said to have close relation to the ritual. While translating a mantra I have kept in view the relation of the mantra to the corresponding Brāhmaṇa. In this behalf I have consulted the commentaries by Bhatta Bhaskara and Sāyaṇa on the Taittiriya texts, who I believe, even though remote in time from the Taittiriya texts, were mostly conversant with that relation through their intimate knowledge of the continued ritual tradition. Even then I have not ignored the principles of Philology in translating the mantras.
In translating the Sūtra-text I have consulted Bhavasvamin&rsquo;s Bhāṣya and also the commentary Subodhini as far as it is available. Even then certain points have remained obscure to me. Footnotes are added to the translation. References to the original sources of the mantra and Brahmana passages are given in the Footnotes.
The Dvaidhasutra always goes in concurrence with the main text. Caland has, in his edition of the text, tried to give the references to the main text while presenting the Dvaidhasūtra. In some cases references have not been given by him.PREFACE
vii
I have tried my best to give at such places the references to the main text. The same thing applies to the Karmantasūtra also. I have tried to make the translation as literal as possible. Words essential for clear understanding have been put in parenthesis.
Bhavasvamin&rsquo;s vivarana on a major portion of the Baudhayana Śrautasūtra is available in manuscripts. Caland had intended to edit this vivarana which is a veritable source for good understanding of Baudhāyana&rsquo;s text. He however abandoned his design since the manuscript-material available to him was utterly insufficient. He has stated, &ldquo;Perhaps I may in later times fulfil also this promise. (Preface to Vol. II p. xi). He however could not do so. T.N. Dharmadhikari has prepared a critical edition of the vivarana after a careful study of the available defective manuscripts. He has tried his best to present a readable text of the vivarana and has recorded the variants in Foot-notes. The vivarana is appended. A Glossary is also appended. The index of words prepared by my student Smt. Leena Sabnis will be found useful for a scientific study of the text.
I am grateful to the authorities of the Indira Gandhi National Centre for the Arts, New Delhi, for assigning the project to me. I have tried to complete it to the best of my ability. The Centre granted me all facilities for the carrying out of the project. I am glad to acknowledge the help which I have received in completing the project. Caland&rsquo;s scholarly monograph Uber das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana was a constant help to me. Many decades have passed since Caland published his monumental work. Knowledge of the ritualistic religion has considerably advanced during this time, and it has become possible to add to our knowledge of Baudhāyana&rsquo;s text. I have also consulted Caland&rsquo;s voluminous work on other Vedic texts and the scholarly work of Indian and western scholars including J.Gonda&rsquo;s History of Indian Literature. I thank Kumari Saroj Deshpande for neatly preparing the typescript of
the translation.
When in 1903 he published his important monograph Über das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhayana, W. Caland concluded by saying, &ldquo;Möchte es mir gelingen sein, ein Interesse für diesen Text zu wecken&rdquo; (p. 65). By simultaneously publishing his important edition of the Baudhāyana Srautasūtra, he may be said to have laid the foundation not only of the all-round study of this oldest Srautasūtra but also of the Śrauta texts in general. Since then significant research work has been done in the field of the ritual Sūtras. I hope this edition of the revised text together with translation and Bhavasvamin&rsquo;s vivarana will give a new impetus to the study of the Vedic ritualistic religion.

INTRODUCTION</p>
<ol>
<li>The Baudhayana Corpus
The Baudhayana Śrautasūtra forms the initial and prominent part of the Baudhayana corpus.&rsquo; This corpus comprises the Śrauta, Prayaścitta, Śulba, Grhya, Pitṛmedha, Pravara and Dharma Sutras. Tradition ascribes all these Sūtras to Baudhayana. While preparing his critical edition of the Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra (BaudhŚS), W. Caland examined all available manuscripts of the above-mentioned types of the Sūtra-texts ascribed to Baudhāyana, and formulated the order of the Baudhayana corpus.2 In the printed edition of the Śrautasūtra the Śulbasūtra forms the Praśna XXX. The Pravarasutra printed at the end is without the consecutive Praśna number.
14
Subsequent to the Śrautasūtra there is the Gṛhyasutra3 comprising four Praśnas including the Prayaścitta. &ldquo;This Sūtra the greater part of which is no doubt comparatively old, is composed in the Baudhāyana style; discussions, motivations and even implicit polemics are not absent. The Gṛhyasütra proper is followed by the so-called Grhya-Paribhāṣāsūtra which consists of two Praśnas. Being generally speaking a collection of additions and enlarge- ments, it seems to owe its curious title to the desire of the compiler, not only to add some more definitions and general rules of interpretation but also, following the example of the Karmantasūtra of the Śrauta manual, to collect these in separate chapters annexed to the discussions of the Grhya rites.
This collection may in the course of time have become the nucleus of the present two Praśnas. That this text has been recast and greatly enlarged is beyond all doubt. There is yet another Grhya part, namely, the Grhyaparisiṣṭa-or Grhyaseṣasūtra which comprises four Prašnas consisting of older and later material. Rites which occur also in other works of this class and create the impression of being Vedic-for instance the Yamayajña in 1.21 and the Vṛṣotsarga in 3.16-existed in all probability long before the compilation of these paralipomena. This collection has, on the other hand, received considerable additions many of which are much later than the composition of the proper Grhyasutra. The latest additions do not belong to the Vedic, but to the post-Vedic Hindu (so-called Purāņic) rituals, and
xii
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA
concern the cult of typically Hinduist deities viz. Śiva, Durgā, and Skanda. Parallels, if any, occur only in other doubtless late specimens of this literature and further in works of the Puranic and Agamic genres.5
8
The Baudhayana Pitṛmedhasūtra comprises three Praśnas; the Baudhāyana Pravarasutra consists of only one Praśna.7 The last portion of the Baudhāyana corpus, namely, the DharmasutraR comprises four Praśnas; Prašna IV is an interpolation. This Dharmasūtra is later than the Gautama Dharmasutra which is referred to in the Baudhayana Dharmasūtra.</li>
<li>Baudhāyana-the Pravacanakāra
Mahadeva, at the beginning of his commentary on the Satyāṣādha Kalpasūtra, pays homage to the Sūtrakāras of the Taittiriya recension where Baudhayana is mentioned first. This denotes that among the followers of the Taittiriya recension Baudhāyana was taken to be the seniormost teacher. In the Utsarjana-rite to be performed by a boy who has udergone the Upanayana rite the gods, Rṣis, Acāryas and the Pitrs are beseeched to be present and receive honour. Here the list of the Acāryas of the Taittirīya recension begins with Baudhāyana who is called as a pravacanakāra.o Apastamba is called as a sūtrakāra. In other Taittiriya Sūtra-texts also the list begins with Baudhayana. Thus the entire Taittiriya tradition respects Baudhayana as the seniormost ācārya. It calls Baudhāyana&rsquo;s text as a pravacana and each of the other texts as a Sutra. There is a difference in a pravacana and a Sūtra. A pravacana is a discourse which is orally delivered. A Sutra is not so; it is a collection of sūtras which are composed. Naturally a pravacana is extensive; sutrais brief. Brevity is a comparative term. While in the texts like Pāṇini&rsquo;s Aṣṭādhyāyī the author would try his utmost to attain brevity in his expression even by saving half a mātrā, it cannot be so in the other types of Sūtra-texts like the Kalpasūtras.
The Kalpasūtras came to be composed with a specific purpose. It was difficult to perform any ritual simply by studying the mantra and the Brahmana concerned. A guide laying down the ritual following a particular Veda in a regular order was a necessity. Such manuals had to be studied closely side by side with the actual Veda. In order that the strain on the memory of the person concerned should be minimum, the manual had to be as short as possible. Consequently the manuals came to be composed in sutra-form. At the same time the concise sutra-form left certain ambiguities; so that Bhāṣyas and Paddhatis were composed in order to fill in the vacuum. The case of a pravacana was different; a detailed running exposition
INTRODUCTION

afforded much facility to the priest in performing his part of the ritual. Even then by its very nature the ritual is such a thing that a full understanding of the on-going rite was next to impossible. One therefore finds that even a pravacana was provided with a Bhāṣya and a Prayoga.
&hellip;
That the BaudhSS is a pravacana is shown also by the use of demonstra- tive pronouns with deictic force, i.e. imām diśaṁ nīrasyati 1.6; athe&rsquo;mām abhimṛśati 1.19; imām disaṁ nītvāII.8; imām diśam nirasya IV.6; ¿yaty agre haraty athe&rsquo;yaty athe&rsquo;yati II.17; ittham aśvaṁ visāsate&rsquo;tthā3m XV.30. Baudhāyana has in his lectures prescribed the mantras generally in extenso. There are of course exceptions. Looseness in uniformity may also point out the character of oral discourses. In Praśna X (Cayana) and also in Praśna XI (Vājapeya) the rule of sakalapatha has exceptions. In connection with the duties at the Full- moon and the New-moon sacrifices the BaudhSS prescribes sipping of water with the verse payasvatir oṣadhayaḥ&hellip; at two places (III.15,22) which indicates looseness. The formula taya devatayā &hellip; and the verse tā asya südadohasaḥ are very frequently prescribed in the Praśna (X) for Cayana. Once they are given (X.21) there is no need to repeat them in subsequent occurrences. Therefore Baudhāyana very often simply says tayādevataṁ kṛtvā sūdadohasaṁ karoti. But in X.36 where he has referred simply to tayadevata and sūdadohasa a few times, at one place he has repeated the formula and the verse which is probably due to oral transmission. The general practice of Baudhāyana is that once he has prescribed a mantra in extenso, he mentions it by pratika at a subsequent occurrence or occurrences. There are certain exceptions to this rule. The verse mano jyotir&hellip; is given in extenso in BaudhSS III.18 and again in III.29. The formula vedo&rsquo;si vittir asiis given in III.30 in extensoand also immediately afterwards with a small change. All this points to the fact that Baudhayana orally transmitted the discourses to his disciples. Probably he was the first ācārya who set the ritual of the Taittirīya recension in order for the facility in performance, and orally explained it to his pupils. 10</li>
<li>Authorship of the Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra
Tradition assigns the authorship of the entire Baudhayana Kalpasütra to Baudhāyana. Before tackling the wider problem, it will be proper to confine the discussion to the authorship of the BaudhŚS alone. Leaving out the Sulba, Gṛhya, Pitṛmedha, Pravara and Dharma Sutras, the Śrautasūtra itself covers Praśnas I-XXIX. Its broad divisions are: the main Sutra I-XIX, Dvaidha XX-XXIII, Karmanta XXIV-XXVI, and Prayaścitta XXVII-XXIX.
xiv
BAUDHAYANASRAUTASŪTRA
Can we attribute the authroship of these four broad divisions of this Sūtra&ndash; text to a single ācārya Baudhāyana? Prima facieit may be taken that Baudhāyana himself composed all the four divisions. The claim will have, however, to be substantiated by strong evidence. The character of a pravacana would be one of the points to be considered. Keeping aside for the time being the main Sūtra, the Dvaidha may be examined first. The Dvaidhasūtra presupposes the main text. It records the different views of the acaryas of the Baudhayana school on the various rites, and while doing so, it always refers to the main text. The names of the following ācāryas are mentioned therein: Añjīgavi, Atreya, Adya or Ajya, Artabhāgiputra, Aupamanyava, Aupamanyavīputra, Kātya, Jyāyān Kâtyāyana, Kauṇapatantri, Gautama, Dīrghavātsya, Baudhāyana, Mangala, Maitreya, Maudgalya, Dakṣiṇākāra Rāthītara, Rāthītara and Śālīki. It is to be noted that this list of the acaryas includes the name of Baudhayana himself. The Dvaidhasūtra therefore cannot be said to have been composed by Baudhāyana himself. At the same time it has to be conceded that the different views on the various rites prevailed at the time of the composition of the main text itself. It may, therefore, be said that the Dvaidhasūtra was composed by some pupil of Baudhāyana or pupil&rsquo;s pupil at a time not very distant from the date of the composition of the main text.
Generally there is correspondence between the main text and the Dvaidhasutra. There is however no Dvaidhasūtra for the Pravargya (Praśna IX), the Aśvamedha (Praśna XV), Samāvartana (XVII.39-44), Naiṣṭyayana (XVII.45-46), Vrātyastoma (XVIII.24-26), Bhāllavistoma (XVIII.27-30) and the Ekāhas (XVIII.37-52). In the Dvaidhasutra each topic is introduced by saying vyākhyāsyāmaḥ e.g. athāto&rsquo;gnikalpaṁ vyākhyāsyāmaḥ (XXII.1). This shows that the Dvaidhasutra was equally understood as an authority for the prescription of the ritual. A comparison of the views recorded in the Dvaidha with the original injunctions recorded in the main text shows that corre- sponding injunctions are sometimes wanting in the main text.11
Generally a unit of the Dvaidhasūtra first reproduces the pratika referring to a point for discussion from the main text, and then records the different views on that point held by the Acaryas of the Baudhayana school. The different views may be two in minimum and any number-five or six-in maximum. In most cases the injunction recorded in the main text is the view of some Acarya, in many cases, of Baudhayana. In such cases the unit begins with the remark that the sutra, that is, the view reproduced therein is the view of such and such teacher, and then records the views held in that

behalf by Acāryas. Sometimes the injunction recorded in the main text is an optional one. In such a case the Dvaidhasūtra mentions the names of the Acāryas advocating those respective views. Obviously the occasion for the variety of views arises out of the absence of a direct injunction in the Brāhmaṇa concerned. There is no source to understand the practice in respect of the omitted item which Brāhmaṇakāra himself intended. It was natural that in course of time different practices were introduced in the various geographical areas. These became known to the ritual-world when the priestly class had occasions to come together and undertake ritualistic performances in coordination. Among the various Acāryas two names occur prominently-Baudhāyana and Śālīki. It is observed that Baudhāyana gen- erally represents the conservative view while Śālīki lays stress on simplicity and convenience.12 It is interesting to note that whatever divergent view on some topic might have been expressed by any of the other Śrautasūtras, it is almost found advocated by some Acārya belonging to the Baudhayana school. It seems that during the period of the ritualistic activities of the Baudhayana school which immediately succeeded the Brāhmaṇa period, the ritual-tradition was strong and that the lively interest in practices gave rise to different views in regard to the topics not prescribed or discussed in the Brāhmaṇas.
The Karmantasūtra which covers Praśnas XXIV-XXVI provides the explications of sacrificial rituals. It supplements or clarifies the rituals laid down in the main text. At the opening it makes certain general observations. It also lays down the objectives of certain rituals and rites. While the main text employs the present tense in all its prescriptions, the Karmantasūtra em- ploys the present tense and the potential mood in a mixed manner. Like the main text it also speaks in details so much so that sometimes the detailed description becomes monotonous. In this respect the Khanḍikās 14 and 15 of Praśna XXV are worthy of note. The topic is the rites to be performed by the Adhvaryu at early dawn on the pressing day of the Agnistoma. Khaṇḍikā 14 lays down Baudhāyana&rsquo;s view while the Khandika 15 lays down Śālīki&rsquo;s view. Both the Khandikās are identical. The difference is that while accord- ing to Baudhayana the ladles filled with clarified butter are to be carried directly to the Uttaravedi, according to Śālīki they are first to be carried towards the Agnidhrīya chamber and then towards the Uttaravedi.
Sometimes the Karmantasütra provides an optional injunction. While BaudhŚS II.18 prescribes the offering of the Pūrṇahuti with the verse sapta
xvi
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA
te agne&hellip; the Karmanta XXIV.17 mentions a prose formula, agnaye pṛthivyai vāyave &rsquo;ntarikṣāya sūryāya dive varuṇāyā&rsquo;dbhyaḥ svāhā. The commentary subodhini on II.18 treats this formula as an option. While II.18 prescribes milk as the oblation for the Agnihotra, Karmānta XXIV.17 mentions the clarified butter. While II.18 prescribes the wiping of the Agnihotra-ladle first in the upward and then in the downward direction, Karmanta XXIV.17 prescribes the reverse order. Sometimes one comes across in the Karmanta a mere repetition of a rite prescribed in the main text, e.g. the formulas to be recited for the drawing out and the depositing of the Ahavaniya fire are prescribed in the main text (III.4); they are repeated in the Karmanta (XXIV.30). Karmanta XXIV.30 is an exact copy of III.4 prescribing the Agnihotra-rite. The Karmanta has taken cognisance of one who has not set up the sacred fires; XXIV. 32 speaks about the Pinḍapitṛyajña and XXIV.33 about the Agrayana to be performed by one who has not set up the fires.
The Rājasuya is prescribed in BaudhŚS XII. The Karmanta XXVI.3 lays down also a variety of the Rajasuya called Añjaḥsava according to Baudhāyana and another variety of the same according to Śālīki. It also lays down a different kind of the Rājasūya, namely, the Patantaka. The Vādhūla Śrautasūtra (X) has not mentioned any variety of the Rājasūya. As regards the setting up of the fires, BaudhŚS II.12 mentions a piece of wood of a tree struck by lightning among the substances to be put into the fire-places before the setting of fires. As substitute for such a tree, the Karmānta (XXIV.14) has mentioned a tree dried up by cold or by wind. Neither the Vādhūla nor any other Śrautasūtra has mentioned these substitutes.
The characteristics mentioned above point to the conclusion that the Karmāntasūtra was composed not by Baudhāyana but by somebody belong- ing to the Baudhāyana school at a late date. The traditional position of the Karmanta subsequent to the Dvaidha supports the conclusion.
Praśnas XXVII-XXIX are called the Prayaścittasutra. They deal with the expiation-rites in respect of ritual-deficiencies in the Agnihotra, Darśa- Pūrṇamāsa, Cãturmāsyas, Nirūḍhapaśu, Agnistoma, Agnicayana, Ekāhas and Sattras. Besides the expiation-rites the section includes the incidental rites, the so-called Anugrahas and certain other topics befitting the charac- ter of the Karmanta. Most of the Śrautasūtras have allotted only one chapter for the expiation-rites.
It needs to be observed that we find in the main text expiation-rites laid down side by side with the Adhvaryava at different places. No expiation-riteINTRODUCTION
xvii
is mentioned for the Agnyadheya. We find expiation-rites prescribed in regard to the deficiencies in the Agnihotra-rite at the following places: nine in Praśna XIV (Aupānuvākya), four in Praśna XIII (Işțikalpa), one in the Dvaidha (XX.19) and two in the Karmanta (XXIV 23;31). For the Darsa- Pūrṇamāsa: three in Praśna III. 15-22 (Yājamāna), four in Praśna XIII (Iṣṭikalpa), one in Praśna XVII.50 (Kāmya Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa). For the Nirūḍhapaśu: one in Prašna XIV (Aupānuvākya). For Agniṣṭoma: sixteen in Praśna XIV (Aupānuvākya). In regard to the Pravargya, all expiation-rites have been laid down in Praśna IX (Pravargya) together with the main rite. These facts show that Baudhayana intended to lay down the expiation-rites side by side with the Adhvaryava; he did not intend to collect the expiation- rites separately in any Prašna. Some follower of the Baudhayana school felt it necessary to devote special space to the expiation-rites in the Sūtra-text following the practice of the other Śrautasūtras. While doing so, he took care not to touch the expiation-rites already dealt with in the Sutra-text following the Taittiriya texts. He recorded such expiation-rites as had become estab- lished in his time. For example, BaudhŚS XXIX. 3 has prescribed an incidental rite in case the moon does not become visible at night. the Sūtrakāra has prescribed the offering of two spoonfuls with the verses navonavo bhavati jāyamānaḥ&hellip; and yam ādityā aṁśumāрyāyayanti&hellip; (TS.II.4.14). · Here is a secondary employment of these two verses which are originally prescribed as the puronuvākyā and the yājyā to be recited by the Hot in an Işti to be performed by one who is suffering from a chronic disease (TSII.3.5).
It is difficult to believe that all the three Prašnas were composed by one and the same person. We do not know whether the incidental rites, the Anugrahas and the Karmantalike portion were added by the Acārya who composed the additional Prāyaścitta-portion. There are clear indications which show that there was still another hand at work who newly added, particularly in the form of Kārikā, more expiation-rites in regard to the Agnihotra, Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa and other routine rites. It may thus be taken for certain that the Prayaścittasūtra (Praśnas XXVII-XXIX) was composed not by Baudhayana but by one or more Acaryas of the school some time later. We also do not know about the time when the present order of the three Prašnas of the Prayaścittasūtra was fixed.13
Now the main text, Praśnas I-XIX, may be examined from two view- points. Firstly, whether it contains any portion whose authorship normally
xviii
BAUDHAYANAŠRAUTASŪTRA
attributed to Baudhayana may be doubtful, and secondly whether the order of the text fixed by the tradition and adopted in the printed edition was fixed by Baudhayana himself. There is evidence to show that in the main text certain portions were misplaced at a very early period.</li>
<li></li>
</ol>
<p>In this connection Praśna II laying down the ritual of the setting of fires may be cited as an important case. A close study of the ritual and the text- portion describing it shows that the original order of the various Khandikās and other portions must have been different from what it is at present. Praśna II laying down the Agnyādheya comprises twentyone Khaṇḍikās. Dvaidha (XX.16-18) and Karmanta (XXIV.12-17) also deal with this rite. In the main text BaudhŚS II.12 must have been the first Khanḍikā; Khaṇḍikā 1 speaking about the pronouncement the second; Khandikās 3-4 dilating upon the choosing of the priests the third and the fourth; the Khaṇḍikā 2 prescribing the begging of the sacrificial place the fifth; Khandikās 13-14 speaking about the offering of the Brahmaudana the sixth and the seventh; Khanḍikās 8-11 laying down the Gopitṛyajña eighth to eleventh; and Khaṇḍikās 15-21 prescribing the rites beginning with the heating of the kindling woods and ending with the ancillary Istis twelfth to the nineteenth. Out of the remaining three Khaṇḍikās (5-7) Khaṇḍikā 5 records the formulas beginning with simhe me manyuḥ etc. called pāpmano vinidhayaḥ which do not belong to the Taittirīya recension. Hence they were repro- duced by somebody for ready use.15 Khaṇḍikās 6-7 are of the nature of the Karmāntasūtra. They, however, do not fit in with the present Karmāntasūtra.
The basic Soma-sacrifice, namely, the Agnistoma is prescribed in Praśnas VI-VIII, and the Pravargya rite is prescribed in Praśna IX. Even though the position of the Pravargya as Prašna IX was already fixed in the period of Bhavasvāmin (eighth century A.D.) who in his Bhāṣya explains the Pravargya subsequent to the Agnistoma, it cannot be the original order. The Pravargya Praśna covers the preparation of the Mahāvīras and other imple- ments, the preparation and the offering of the Gharma, the disposal of the Pravargya-implements, the expiation-rites, and the Avantaradikṣā to be observed in connection with the learning of the Pravargya-mantras forming part of the Taittiriya Aranyaka - all in a single Praśna. Because the Pravargya rite involves the mantras contained in the Taittiriya Āraṇyaka, Baudhāyana must have assigned to it a position at the end of the entire pravacana. It is very important to observe that the Dvaidha and the Karmanta Sūtras have not taken note of the Pravargya; from the Agnistoma they have proceeded
16

xix
to Agnicayana. Even though the order of the Pravargya was changed for convenience, the ritual was undoubtedly laid down by Baudhāyana.
Some portion of the Sutra-text was lost in tradition. There are two types of the Sautrāmaṇī sacrifice in the Taittiriya-tradition-Caraka and Kaukili. While the Sautrāmaṇī in the Caraka tradition is preserved,17 that in the Kaukili tradition is lost. That it originally existed is clear from Bhavasvāmin&rsquo;s statement in his Bhāṣya that the Baudhāyanasūtra for the Kaukilī Sautrāmaṇī is lost. There is an internal evidence which supports this fact. There is a sutra in the Karmanta (XXIV 11) dvau sautrāmaṇyām, meaning that there are two (offerings to Aditi) in the Sautrāmaṇī. In the Caraka Sautrāmaṇī prescribed in the BaudhŚS there is no offering to Aditi. In the Kaukili Sautrāmaṇī two pots of cooked rice are to be offered to Aditi.18 Thus the reference to Sautrāmaṇī in the Karmantasūtra points to the Kaukilī Sautrāmaṇī which Baudhāyana must have prescribed, and which was lost.
In the Taittiriya tradition the duties to be performed by the Hotr priest in the pre-Soma rites have been prescribed. In BaudhŚS III.27-31 one comes across the duties to be performed by the Hotṛ in the Full-moon and the New- moon sacrifices and also a few hints for those in the Animal-sacrifice. In Sāyaṇa&rsquo;s commentary on BaudhŚS Praśna 119 there are citations from Baudhayana&rsquo;s Hautraśesa Praśna which probably lays down the hautra for the Nirūḍhapaśu and the Caturmasyas following the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa. This Hautraseşṣa Praśna may have been the composition of some scholar of the Baudhāyana school.
The Kāṭhaka Citis have been prescribed in BaudhŚS XIX. Neither the Dvaidhasūtra nor the Karmāntasūtra has taken account of the Kathaka Prašna. In this Praśna mantras have been cited in extenso even in the case of repetition. While BaudhŚS X. 48 has used the word carameṣṭaka, BaudhŚS XIX. 10 employs the word antyestakā. Bhavasvāmin has not written commen- tary on this Praśna. Probably Praśna XIX was added by some follower of the Baudhāyana school.
4. The Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra and the Taittiriya- texts
There is ample evidence to show that the redaction of the Taittiriīya recension was complete and fixed when Baudhayana delivered his dis- courses on the sacrificial religion. In his sūtras Baudhayana first gives the full mantra and then lays down the injunctive part. Not only does he cite the mantras in the order as they are found in the Taittiriya Samhită, most parts
XX
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA
of the Taittiriya Brāhmaṇa and also the Taittirīya Āraṇyaka, but also cites relevant Brāhmaṇa passages introducing them with atha vai bhavati.20 Even though Baudhāyana generally cites mantras from the Taittiriya texts in extenso, he cites by pratika the Puronuvākyā - Yājyā verses collected in the concluding Anuvākas of many Prapathakas of many of the Kāṇḍas of the Samhita and also some other verses. He also cites the mantras to be recited by the Adhvaryu or the sacrificer by saying anucchandasam or by referring to the specific Anuvāka; e.g. while prescribing the Vişņu-strides to be taken by the sacrificer at the Full-moon or the New-moon sacrifice, he records the first formula and further says iti caturbhir anucchandasam. In the Agnicayana while prescribing the pouring down of she-goat&rsquo;s milk in a continuous stream over the leaf of Calotropis gigantea placed on the north-western uppermost brick, he says (X.48) tat pratipadyate namas te rudra manyava ity āʼntam etam anuvākam nigadya dvitīyam trtīyam.&rdquo; He continues to refer to the Taittiriya text in similar terms. Further while speaking about the offering of the vasordhārā, he instructs tat pratipadyate&rsquo;gnāviṣṇā sajoṣase&rsquo;ti sarvām āʼntam vasordhārām (X.54).
22
21
There is another piece of evidence which is equally strong. In the Taittirīya Samhita comprising seven kāndas the third Kāṇḍa is traditionally known as the upānuvākya.23 Bhaṭṭa Bhaskara and Sāyaṇa have taken note of the designation aupānvākyain their commentaries on Kanda III. Upānuvākya means the supplementary scripture. It supplements the mantra and brāhmaṇa recorded in the original sections. Bhatta Bhaskara and Sāyaṇa have eluci- dated the mantra - and brāhmaṇa-portions of this Kāṇḍa with reference to the relevant topics contained in the original sections. Baudhāyana has devoted an entire independent Praśna, namely, the fourteenth, to the explanations of the mantra-brāhmaṇa contained in Kāṇḍa III. This indi- cates that the Taittiriya texts in the Sarasvatapatha stood in the established tradition in Baudhāyana&rsquo; time. Among the Sūtrakāras belonging to the Taittiriya recension, Baudhayana alone has remained true to the tradition of recognising the independent position of the aupānuvākya. The other Sūtrakāras have deemed all the Taittiriya texts as one entity, and have laid down the rituals by exploiting the entire material as a whole. Even the Vādhūla Śrautasūtra has followed the same procedure. The aupānuvākya Kāṇḍa (III) comprises five Prapathakas, and the BaudhŚS XIV serially deals with their contents in Khaṇḍikās 1-22 of that Prašna. In the remaining eight Khaṇḍikās (23-30) it lays down injunctions following TBr 1.4.1-5.3.
INTRODUCTION

Baudhayana thus expanded the extent of his aupānuvākya Praśna because, even though the TBr-portion is really anārabhyādhīta, it is related to the portions dealing with the Soma-rites prescibed in the TS Kāṇḍa III. The Baudhayana Dvaidhasutra presupposes the entire aupānuvākya Praśna XIV.
As already observed, the tradition of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa was established before Baudhayana delivered his discourses. It is, however, to be noted that Baudhāyana has scarcely employed verses from the Acchidrakāṇḍa (TBr III.7) and the Upahomas (TBr II.4,5). The other Sūtrakaras of the Taittiriya recension from Bharadvāja downwards have, on the other hand, fully employed verses from these portions.24
5. The Baudhayana Śrautasūtra and other Vedic Recensions
By their very nature, ritual-practices in the Vedic and the post-Vedic periods were in a rather dynamic condition. The ritualistic religion was a collective activity which was bound to be influenced by the ritual-traditions being maintained within the surrounding areas. There is therefore no wonder that even in the BaudhŚS we come across certain borrowings from the Vedic recensions.
In the Agnistoma sacrifice fire from the Ahavanīya in the Prāgvarśa shed and Soma are carried over to the Mahāvedi on the Upavasatha day (BaudhŚS VI 30). The Adhvaryu carries forward the fire with the verse ud agne tiṣṭhā &rsquo;nu mām etc. which is not traced to the Taittiriya texts. This verse is found in the Vādhūlasūtra (VādhŚS VI.19.21) with a little variation and a small modification in the employment. According to BaudhŚS VII.8 the Adhvaryu hands over two darbha-blades to the Udgātṛ or to the Prastoty with the formula ṛksāmayor upastaraṇam asi mithunatvāya prajātyai or silently. This formula which is not traced to the Taittiriya texts is employed in VadhŚS VII.7.13. This shows Baudhāyana&rsquo;s close association with the Vādhūla tradition. The Agnyādheya prescribed by Baudhāyana includes, among others, two rites, namely, the reciting of the formulas called papmano vinidhyaḥ and the Gopitṛyajña which are absent in the other Taittiriya Sūtra- texts. The VadhŚS has recorded in the Prapathaka XV (Parisesa) the formulas papmano vinidhayaḥ with certain variations; the Sūtra has also referred (1.1.8) to the cooking of a cow as a part of the Agnyadheya.
We find some Kathaka element in Baudhayana&rsquo;s prescriptions. BaudhŚS X. 24 prescribes the laying of a stump of darbha-grass on the site chosen for the Citi either with the formula vāk tvā samudra upadadhātu etc. or silently.
xxii
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA
pre-
This formula which is reproduced as a pratika is borrowed from KS XXXVIII 13. ĀpsS XIX.11.11 has prescribed this formula with a little modification in the Săvitra Kāṭhaka Cayana. In BaudhŚS X.44 the Vibhakti brick is scribed to be piled up with the verse agne stomam manāmahe cited by pratika. The verse is not traced to the Taittiriya texts even though the Brāhmaṇa from the TS (V.5.6.1) says agne stomam manāmaha ity āha. The verse is found in KS XX.14; MS IV.10.2; RVV.13.2 Most probably it was borrowed from the KS. In the Agnyādheya Praśna Baudhāyana (II.12) has prescribed the setting of the Ahavaniya at a distance of twelve steps (vikrāma) following TBI.1.2. The Karmantasūtra (XXIV.1) however thought it advisable to mention the different numbers of steps (prakrama) for a brāhmaṇa, a Rājanya and a Vaiśya following in essence KS VIII.13.
Baudhāyana (VII.9) has prescribed the formula agnir ha daivīnām viśām etc. in connection with the choosing of the sacrificer at the Savaniya animal- sacrifice in Agnistoma. It is not found in the Taittiriya texts; it is traced in part to MS III.9.8. It is found also in ŚBr III.7.4.10 where the choosing takes place at the Agniṣomiya animal-sacrifice. It is difficult to locate the exact source of the Baudhāyana citation.
W. Caland has, in the introduction to his edition of the Satapatha Brāhmaṇa in the Kāṇviya recension 25 discussed the relationship of the Kāṇvīya Satapatha Brāhmaṇa with the Śrautasūtras of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda, particularly with the BaudhSS. He has drawn attention to the similarities in linguistic features and also certain ritual features. If a few features are found to be similar in these two texts in the ocean of linguistic and ritualistic details, they cannot lead one to any drastic conclusion. But Caland has found a few instances where a reference made in the Vājasaneya Brāhmaṇas to the Carakādhvaryus is not traced to any of the available Brāhmaṇas of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda, but is traced to the BaudhŚS. From this fact he hastens to conclude as follows: &ldquo;The ritual of Baudhayana must have been known to the authors of the Vājasaneya Brāhmaṇas, that his Sūtra is prior to it&hellip;. How then are we to account for the agreement of Baudhāyana with the white Yajurveda ? It is not without hesitation that I venture to offer a conjecture on this point. From the researches of Bühler regarding the texts of Baudhāyana we know that the name of this author probably was Kāṇva Baudhayana. Now could not Baudhāyana originally have been a Kanva i.e. a follower of the Kanva school of the White Yajurveda and subsequently gone over to the Black Yajurveda refining many reminiscences of his former Śakha? This renunciation of
INTRODUCTION
xxiii
school might then have taken place before the final redaction of the two Vājasaneya Brāhmaṇas the authors of which may have known his ritual but could not but regard him as a renegade. In this way alone, it seems to me, can we account for the hostility which the texts of the white Yajurveda show towards a Kāņva to whom it is prohibited to offer any sacrificial fee if they are among the Prasarpakas. Now it is very remarkable that while Apastamba, Bharadvaja and Hiranyakeśin exclude the Kāņvas from the receipt of Dakṣiņās, this prohibition is not made by Baudhāyana though it could be natural enough if my conjecture were right and Baudhāyana had once been a Kānva.&rdquo; (pp. 99-101)
This strange conjecture of Caland needs serious consideration. Firstly, Caland has inferred that since the view of &lsquo;some&rsquo; teachers expressed in the Vājasaneya Brāhmaṇas is not traced to any of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda recensions, but is found in the BaudhŚS, the latter must be taken to have been known by both the Vajasaneya Brāhmaṇas. These Brāhmaṇas often mention a different ritualistic view belonging to the Carakādhvaryus or &lsquo;some&rsquo; teach- ers. At present we know only three or four recensions of the Carakādhvaryus i.e. Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda. Patanjali has mentioned in his Mahābhāṣya one hundred and one recensions of Yajurveda out of which eightysix belonged to the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda. It is not impossible that the Brahmaṇakāras were aware of such a recension, not known to us, representing the ritualistic view which might have been mentioned in that Brāhmaṇa and which is found also in the BaudhŚS. Moreover, it is certainly to be borne in mind that, barring the numerous so-called Sāmveda Brāhmaņas, no Brāhmaṇa text was composed subsequent to any Śrautasūtra. Traditionally the mantra-brāhmaṇa are apauruşeya, and Śrautasūtras are pauruşeya. These two types of literature must be chronologically distinguished. Therefore the BaudhaŚS cannot be taken to have been composed before the Vajasaneya Brāhmaṇas.
Secondly, in the Baudhayana texts (GS III.9.6; DHS II.6) the author is mentioned as Kāṇva Baudhāyana, that is, Baudhāyana belonging to the Kanva gotra. This gotra is mentioned in the Baudhāyana Pravarasūtra (21 and 54; also ApPravaraS XXIV 8.2-3). This Kanva was of course different from the Vajasaneya Kanva. Caland&rsquo;s conjecture on the basis of the identical name Kanva that Baudhāyana first was a follower of Kāṇva recension and later adopted the Taittiriya recension is therefore absurd. Caland has taken the support of one more fact: Dakṣiņās are to be given away to the visitors (prasarpaka) at a Soma sacrifice. Bharadvāja, Āpastamba and Satyāṣāḍha
xxiv
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA
Hiranyakeŝin (also Vaikhānasa) have said that one should not give Dakṣiņās to those belonging to the Kanva and Kasyapa gotras. Caland has also noted a similar statement from KāthS XXVIII.4. Such a prohibition is however not found in the BaudhŚS. This was natural, Caland says, because Baudhāyana was primarily a Kānva. In this connection it may be noted that the absence of such prohibition is found in many other Śrautasūtras also, e.g. Vadhula, Mānava, Āśvalāyana, Šārikhāyana, Lāṭyāyana, Drāhyāyaṇa and Vaitāna. So there is nothing special about Baudhāyana. The non-Baudhayana Taittirīya Sūtras observed the prohibition probably under the influence of the Kāṭhakas. It is important to note that the KatyŚS (X.2.32) itself belonging to the Vājasaneyas prohibits the giving away of Dakṣiņās to those belonging to the Kanva and Kasyapa gotras. It is therefore evident that the prohibition of giving away Dakṣiņās to the followers of the Kanva gotra has nothing to do with the alleged relation between Kanva and Baudhayana. Caland&rsquo;s conjec- ture regarding the Kaṇva-Baudhāyana relationship is therefore groundless. The Samaveda claims great significance in the characterisation of a Soma-sacrifice. The individuality of a Soma-sacrifice mostly depends upon the specifications given in the Sāmaveda-brāhmaṇas. Even then the Sutra- texts of Yajurveda have something to prescribe in respect of the Adhvaryu&rsquo;s duties. Baudhāyana generally follows the Tandya Mahābrāhmaṇa in dealing with the Ekāhas and the Ahinas. Even then he has maintained his individu- ality in that behalf on the authority of the Taittirīya Brāhmaṇa. The Vratyastoma prescribed in the TaṇḍBr. and in BaudhŚS XVIII.24-26 is not laid down in the TBr. Bhallavistoma prescribed in BaudhŚS XVIII.27 is not traced to the TāṇḍBr nor to the TBr. In the Dvaidhasutra (XXIII.13) is prescribed the Gobala Daśarātra sacrifice which is not found in the TandBr.
The Dvaidha, the Karmanta and the Prāyaścitta Sūtras seem to have come under the influence of the Rgveda. BaudhŚS XXVIII.2 has prescribed the Pavitreşti which may be performed as an incidental or optional rite. The puronuvākyā and yājyā verses prescribed herein for the Ájyabhāga offering to Soma are from the Rgveda, namely, yo dhārayā pāvakayā (IX.101.2; ĀśvŚS II.12.3) and ā kalaśeṣu dhāvati (IX.17.4, AśvŚS II.12.4). In the Agnistoma sacrifice the Pātnīvata draught is taken from the Agrayana vessel (BaudhŚS VIII.14). The Karmantasūtra (XXV.23) wanted to explicate that rite. It says, &ldquo;This (Pātnīvata draught) drawn from the Agrayaṇa vessel is taken for thirtythree divinities. Where are they involved in the offering? In the Pātnīvata draught. It is said in the scripture, &lsquo;Do thou (O Agni) carry over

and
the thirtythree gods together with their wives for the sacrificial drink, be exhilerated.”” (RV IIL.6.9). This half verse is the latter part of the verse which is recited as the yajya for the Pātnīvata offering. cf. AśvŚS V.19. Here is an indication of the deep insight of the ritualists and of the rationale of the rite. Baudhāyana has employed a verse even from the Atharvaveda. He has prescribed the laying of Durva grass as a brick in Agnicayana (X.24). The verse is āyane te parāyaṇe etc. (AV VI.106.1)
6. Linguistic peculiarities of the Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra
W. Caland has in his critical study of the BaudhŚS recorded information on grammar (morphology and syntax), style and lexicography of the BaudhŚS.26 This oldest Śrautasūtra is obviously under the influence of the Vedic language; it has retained many peculiarities of the Vedic language. Caland has already brought out the linguistic peculiarities of the BaudhSS. Any further attempt on this account would indeed be superfluous. Even then, with a view to making this Introduction complete, I would like to present here some select examples even though it would be a mere repeti- tion. A word-index appended to this edition would supply valuable informa- tion to a conscientious reader for his ritualistic and critical study of the text.

Since the BaudŚS is a pravacana, one comes across in it certain
distinctive marks which are rather absent in the Sūtra-texts, or at least are rather keenly felt. A teacher orally giving a discourse would have in his discourse a reflection of depicting a picture of the ritual which he might be visualising at the time. Speaking about the time-span, he says dvādaśyāṁ vyuṣṭāyām II.20; tisṛṣu vyuṣṭāsu XVII.6; srucā pañcamīm juhoti VI.4. When he has to employ a lengthy mantra-portion, he would say something like iti pratipadya ity ataḥ III.18 etc. Sometimes one meets with a natural alliteration: susambħṛtān sambhārān punar eva sambharati 11.6; susambhṛtān sambharaṇyām sambhṛtya VII.6. The prefix su- is joined to a past participle to denote abundance: susambhṛta (above); sūpanibaddha VI.25; susamtṛpta 1.18; suvicita VI.14; sudhupita IX.3. The use of the verbal form āste, āsate with a present participle is typical: ramayanto jāgarayanta āsate XV.3; dhūnvanta āsate IX.8; tām te pibanto ramamāṇā mahīyamānā āsate IX.11; gopayann āste X.1. Similarly the form eti or yanti: stṛṇann eti III.30; utkhidann eti XI.5; hotur vaśaṁ yanti IV.2. The use of the past participle prajñāta is typical: prajñātaṁ nidadhāti X.54; prajñāte barhiṣi nidhāya IV.5 explained by Bhavasvamin as yathā na samsriyete pratyabhijñāte tathā nidhāya.

VI.6= upasthanam eti. Bhavasvāmin explains taiḥ saha saṁgacchata ity arthaḥ, Payāṁsi víśāsti VI.34 “(The Adhvaryu) gives directions as regards the man- agement of the milk.&rdquo; When any action is to be done by somebody, not by a specific person, plural verbal form is used: athā&rsquo; smai madhuparkaṁ ca gāṁ ca prahuḥ VI.17; hvayanti patnim hvayanti hotaram IV.7. When various views are to be expressed, the pronouns eka and apara are used e.g. tasmād yajñavāstu nā ’bhyavetyam iti, ahorātrāv ity ekam, yāvad agnayaḥ śītāḥ syur ity etad ekam, yāvad enam abhivarṣed ity etad aparam XXVI.7.
Because a ritual is to be carried on with the collaboration of a number of persons, it becomes essential for the Adhvaryu, the chief executive priest, to give directions (sampraiṣa) to different persons at one and the same time. This is customary to all Yajurveda-Sūtrakāras. In the BaudhŚS however the occasions are more frequent, and the calls indeed are beautiful composi- tions. e.g. brahman pravargyena pracariṣyāmo hotar gharmam abhiṣṭuhy agnid rauhiņau puroḍāśāv adhiśraya pratiprasthātaḥ pravargyaṁ vihara prastotaḥ sāmāni gāya IX.6. &ldquo;O Brahman, we shall proceed with the Pravargya-rite; O Hotr, do you recite verses in praise of the Gharma; O Agnidh, do thou put on fire the two Rauhina cakes; O Pratiprasthātṛ, do you arrange the Pravargya - imple- ments; O Prastotṛ, do you chant the (relevant) Sāmans”. One of the peculiarities of Baudhayana is that his Adhvaryu has many occasions to call upon the sacrificer to do his duties, and he does so by addressing him with the words ehi yajamāna &ldquo;Come on, O sacrificer..
When there is an occasion for the Hotṛ or for the Udgātr to perform his part of the ritual, the Sūtrakāra refers to it by the expression yathā sa veda, yatha te viduḥ, yathāvedam (VI.27; VII.1;14). When there is an occasion for a discussion of a certain topic, Baudhāyana has used the term mīmāṁsā following the practice of the Brāhmaṇa-texts; e.g. athā&rsquo;ta āprīṇām eva mīmāṁsā X.11; atha&rsquo;taḥ prayāṇasyai’va mīmāṁsāVI.9; X.17; atha&rsquo; to bhasmana eva&rsquo;tivṛddhasya mīmāṁsāX.18; atha&rsquo;taḥ sarpaṇasyai&rsquo;va mīmāṁṣāXVI.9; athā&rsquo;ta utthānānām eva mīmāṁsā XIX.5. When Baudhāyana has to refer to a view of some teachers in respect of some ritualistic item, he does so by saying iti vadantah following the Brahmaņa style, e.g. anu hai&rsquo;ke samyanti pasava iḍe&rsquo;ti vadantaḥ VII.12. The next sutra in such an instance is negative, and it begins with tad u tathā na kuryāt.
The linguistic peculiarities recorded above cover all the four divisions of the BaudhŚS. It cannot however, be claimed on the basis of these peculiarities that one and the same author composed the entire BaudhŚS. It was quite natural that the immediate descendants of Baudhāyana who

fulfilled the mission of their teacher naturally imitated his style while doing their job.
7. Literature on the Baudhāyana Śrautasūtra
30
Generally the Śrautasutras are provided with means of comprehension such as the Bhāṣya, Ṭīkā, Paddhati, Kārikā and Prayoga. Bhavasvamin composed a Bhāṣya called vivaraṇa on the BaudhŚS. The Bhasya on Prasnas I-XVIII; XX-XXVI is available in manuscript-form.28 The Bhasya on Praśna I (Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa) is published.29 The manuscripts of the Bhasya are broken and have a corrupt text. W. Caland had thought of editing this Bhāṣya, but he abandoned the idea on account of defective manuscript- material. The Bhāṣya is short. Bhavasvamin aimed at elucidating only such points as were abstruse in his opinion. He lived in the eighth century A.D. Bhatta Bhaskara the commentator of the Taittiriya texts who lived before Sāyaṇa speaks respectfully about Bhavasvāmin. Personal names ending with - svāmin probably belonged to a specific period, e.g. Bhavasvāmin, Bharatasvāmin, Skandasvāmin, Kṣīrasvāmin etc. Most of them were Mīmāmsakas. An inscription dated Śaka 627 mentions a cluster of brāhmaṇa- names ending with -svāmin( cf. JBBRASIII 208, Bombay 1851). An undated inscription also gives such names (JAOSVI.589, cf. A. Weber, History of Indian Literature p. 79 and note). Burnell (p.26) has placed Bhavasvamin in the eighth century A.D. Bhavasvamin&rsquo;s bhāṣya, the oldest on the oldest Śrautra- sūtra, needs to be published in the interest of the history of the ritualistic religion. The attempts towards that direction are therefore welcome.
Sāyaṇa has written a commentary on Praśna I (Darsa-Pūrṇamāsa).29 He was a follower of the Baudhayana school; therefore he cited the BaudhŚS in his commentary on the TS at the beginning; subsequently he shifted to the ApŚS. Vasudeva Dikṣita of Thanjavur wrote a commentary called mahāgnisarvasva on the tenth Praśna (Agnicayana) of the BaudhŚS and also on XVII.11-16 (Ekādaśinī). Both are in manuscript-form. Venkaṭeśvara wrote a commentary on the Karmāntasūtra (XXIV-XXVI), Dvārakānātha- yajvan wrote a commentary on the Prayaścittasutra (XXVII-XXIX) and also on the Sulbasūtra (Praśna XXX in Caland&rsquo;s edition).
Mahādeva Vājapeyin of Thanjavur has written a commentary called subodhini on Praśnas I-VIII.31 It is extensive and is based on the vivarana of Bhavasvamin. It reproduces relevent portions from the Dvaidha and the Karmânta while elucidating the main Sutra, and renders great help in
XXX
BAUDHAYANASRAUTASŪTRA
understanding the text. At the beginning of his commentary Mahadeva Vājapeyin has given his geneology and has also given information about his patron, the Maratha King of Thanjavur. Other members of his family also composed works pertaining to the Baudhayana rituals.32 This family was resident of Shahajirājapuram-modern Tiruvisanalloor near Kumbakonam (Thanjavur district). Shahajirājapuram was donated by Shahaji the ruler of Thanjavur as an agrahāra to fortysix learned Pandits well-versed in the different branches of Sanskrit learning. Mahadeva Vājapeyin who lived in the seventeenth century A.D. was the Adhvaryu of Tryambakarāya Makhin, Minister of Thanjavur. Tryambakarāya was the younger brother of Narasimharāya, father of Anandaraya Makhin who wrote, among other works, the Aśvalāyanasūtravṛtti.
Sometimes the subhodhini gives readings of the Sūtra-text which are different from those in the printed text. Since it closely follows the vivarana of Bhavasvamin, its different renderings may be said to have the same value as that of the vivaraṇa, because many times Bhavasvamin who is too short in his explanations is silent on the elucidation of certain words from the Sūtra- text. Mahādeva Vājapeyin often cites passages from several Śrautasūtras. Being a South Indian, he quotes, among others, the Drāhyāyaṇa Śrautasūtra of Samaveda which was followed in Tamil Nadu. He never quotes the Latyāyana Śrautasūtra which was followed in Gujarat and Varanasi. The late and detailed production of the subodhini suffers at the same time from a draw-back, namely, that sometimes it is not definite about the old tradition of the Sūtra; at certain places it gives optional renderings.
Coming to the Prayoga literature, we meet with the oldest Prayogakāra, namely, Kesavasvāmin who wrote his prayogasāra presenting the manuals of all the major sacrifices.33 Kesavasvāmin is referred to by Rāmāgnicit in his Vṛtti on Dhūrtasvamin&rsquo;s bhāṣya on the ApŚS. Rudradatta, the commentator of the ApŚS often cites Kesavasvamin. Besides the commentary on BaudhŚS I (Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa) Sāyaṇa composed manuals called yajñatantrasudhānidhi of several rituals.34 Anantadeva wrote several works on Dharmaśāstra. In his samskārakaustubha he has given the pedigree of his patron family. His patron, named Bājbahadur, was reigning in Himalayan territories. Anantadeva&rsquo;s literary career may be assigned to the third quarter of the seventeenth century (1645-75). There are Prayogas written by persons belonging to the family of Seṣa which, originally resident of Nanded on the bank of river Godavari in Marathawada (Mahārashtra) migrated to Varanasi in the six-
INTRODUCTION
xxxi
teenth century A.D. and won great honour among the Pandits of Varanasi. A member of the Navahasta family is also credited with the composition of Prayogas following the BaudhSS. Gopala wrote a manual known as Gopalakārikā dilating upon the Darśa-Pūrṇamāsa and Agnicayana.
8. The Chronology of the Baudhayana Śrautasūtra
The chronology of the BaudhŚS, indeed of any Śrautasūtra, is a vexed problem. As we have already seen, there are the Śrauta, Grhya and Dharma Sūtras which are ascribed to Baudhāyana. There are also the Sulba, the Pravara, the Gṛhyaparibhāṣa and the Gṛhyaśeṣa Sūtras with which Baudhayana&rsquo;s name is associated. W. Caland35 has enumerated all these Sūtra-texts and has also made an attempt to fix their order in the tradition. It cannot be said that all these works were compiled by one and the same person. The pravacana style of the BaudhŚS is absent in the other Sutra-texts. Even in regard to the BaudhŚS we have seen that the Dvaidha, the Karmānta and the Prayaścitta sections were the compositions of the descendants of Baudhayana. Therefore while speaking about the chronology of the BaudhŚS, I have in view Praśnas I-XVIII (excluding the Kathaka Praśna XIX) of the BaudhŚS which are before us in the literary form given to Baudhāyana&rsquo;s lectures by his disciples.
It is appropriate first to fix the relative chronology before attempting to fix the date. Mahadeva has paid homage to the Taittiriya Sūtrakāras at the beginning of his commentary vaijayanti on the SatyāṣādhaŚS. Here he has begun with the name of Baudhāyana, and his order of the Sūtrakāras is mostly acceptable also as a chronological one. From the linguistic pecularities of the BaudhŚS as already recorded, it becomes obvious that Baudhāyana was very much under the influence of the idiom of the Taittiriya mantra and Brahmana which formed the basis of his ritual discourses. It was natural that all the nuances of the Vedic language should flow down in his composition.
One of the points helping fixation of relative chronology of the Śrautasūtras is the position of paribhāṣā among them. In most of the Śrautasutras one comes across the paribhāṣā, long or short, laid down at the beginning or in the middle, recorded collectively or in a scattered manner. The Karmanta section of the BaudhSS has at its beginning eleven Khaṇḍikās which bear some similarity with the paribhāṣā. The Prayaścitta section contains a Khanḍikā (XXVII. 14) of a similar nature. The main Sutra includes nothing like the paribhāṣā. This is in full consonance with its pravacana character.
xxxii
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA
The Purva Mīmāṁsā character of discussion is another point in consid- eration of chronology. Certain Śrautasūtras bear the character of discussion as found in the Purva Mimāmsā sūtras. They can therefore be said to have been composed subsequent to the Purva Mīmāṁsā sūtras. The BaudhŚS does not possess any Pūrva Mīmāmsā element. It can therefore be easily taken to have been composed prior to the composition of the Purva Mīmāmsā sūtras.
The Taittiriya Śrautasūtras are of course closely related to the Samhită, Brāhmaṇa and Aranyaka of the Taittirīyas. Almost all Śrautasūtras of this recension presuppose all the Taittiriya texts as have come down in tradition. The BaudhŚS has, however, not cited any verses from the Upahoma and Acchidrakanda sections of the TBr (II.4,5; III.7) as we have already seen. This indicates that in Baudhāyana&rsquo;s time certain parts of the TBr had not attained full recognition. This points to the high antiquity of the BaudhŚS.
The other Śrautasūtras belonging to the Taittirīya recension are: Bharadvaja, Āpastamba, Satyāṣāḍha Hiranyakešin, Vaikhānasa and Vādhūla. The first four out of these are also in the chronological order. The common feature is that all of them are composed in sutra-style. The time-span. between the Bharadvāja-the first and the Vaikhānasa-the last covers a few hundreds of years. Barring minor differences, the ritualistic pattern of all of them is almost the same. While the BaudhŚS often quotes brāhmaṇa- passages from the Taittiriya recension, the BhārŚS quotes only a few, and refers to them by saying iti vijñāyate; brāhmaṇavyākhyātamor yathāsamāṛnātam. While the BaudhSS is silent about the Upahomas and the Acchidrakāṇḍa of the TBr, the BharŚS has cited a few verses from them.
An important difference between the BaudhŚS and the other Taittiriya Sūtras concerns the close relationship between the mantra and its ritualistic employment. In some cases it is observed that while the BaudhŚS is particu- lar in maintaining that relationship, the other Sutra-texts bear a rather loose relation. In BaudhŚS III.21 there is a bunch of four formulas to be recited by the sacrificer as a part of the prayers pertaining to the performance of the Full-moon and the New-moon sacrifices. They are to be recited after the Viṣṇukrama formulas. With the first aganma suvaḥetc. the sacrificer prays to the Ahavaniya. With subhur asi śreṣṭho etc. he prays to Aditya. With idam aham amum etc, he drives away his enemies. With saṁ jyotiṣā bhūvam he touches himself. According to BhārŚS IV.20.8, the sacrificer prays to Aditya with all the four formulas. ApSS IV.14.11 says that the sacrificer prays to Aditya with
ĀpŚS
INTRODUCTION
xxxiii
the verse aganma suvaḥ etc. The Sūtra is silent about the subsequent three formulas which however may be presumed. The relevant Brāhmaṇa (TS 1.7.6) enlightens the rite. It is remarkable that the BaudhŚS, rather than the other Sutras, faithfully follows the intent of the Brāhmaṇa, and may be said to be recording the tradition prevalent in the period of the Brāhmaṇa.
There are numerous other points in the Taittiriya ritualistic tradition where the BaudhŚS differs from others. After the Anuyāja offerings in the Avabhṛtha in the Agniṣṭoma (VIII.20) the Adhvaryu holds the ladle upon the water with samudre te hṛdayam apsv antaḥ&hellip;&hellip; He fills it with water with sam tvā višantu oṣadhir uta&rdquo; paḥ. He offers water into water with yajñasya tvā yajñapate vidhema svāhā. Now the Avabhṛtha-material whichever is besmeared with Soma is scattered upon the water with the verse avabhṛtha nicańkuna&hellip;. He takes water into folded palms with sumitrā na āpa oṣadhayaḥ santu; he throws it towards that direction where his enemy lies with durmitrās tasmai &hellip; . Touching water, he floats (or they float) the residue of Soma together with the skin of black antelope with devir āpa eșa vo garbhas &hellip; (TS 1.4.45). He touches the drops, does not consume them. BhārSS XIV 22.14- 17 prescribes as follows: with samudre te&hellip;. the Adhvaryu strikes into water the ladle filled with the residue of Soma. Wherever a drop of Soma appears, he consumesit with apsu dhautasya&hellip; (TS III.2.5.6). According to some teachers he should merely touch them. They pray to the Avabhṛtha-material with devīrāpa &hellip; ÄpŚS XIV.20.10-21.1 prescribes similarly. Here it will be observed that Baudhāyana&rsquo;s prescriptions are more closely in association with the TS- formulas. There is also difference in the marking of the formulas. Bhaṭṭa Bhaskara and Sāyaṇa on TS I.4.45 have followed Baudhayana. A typical case is the employment of the formula apsu dhautasya&hellip; (TSIII.2.5.7). Baudhāyana (VIII.17) has employed it at its proper place after the offering of the Hāriyojana goblet, so also BhārŚS (XIV.19.3) and ĀpŚS (XIII.17.9). As seen above, BhārŚS and ApSS have reemployed that formula in relation to the Avabhṛtha. Here is an enlargement of the ritual.
Sometimes it is observed that while the BaudhŚS has marked the distinction between the Adhvaryu and the sacrificer in regard to the utterance of the formula, the BhārŚS and the ApŚS have ignored it. According to BaudhŚS VI.5 the Adhvaryu hands over to the sacrificer the horn of black antelope on the occasion of his initiation for the Agnistoma. The Adhvaryu hands it over with indrasya yonir asi; the sacrificer receives it with mā mā himsîḥ. The BhārŚS (X.6.13) and the ApŚS (X.9.17) ask the
xxxiv
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA
Adhvaryu to hand it over with the combined formula indrasya yonir asi mā mā himsiḥ. The propriety of Baudhāyana&rsquo;s prescription is obvious. Another passage may be looked into. TS 1.3.11.1 reads adbhyas tvau&rsquo;ṣadhibhyo mano me hārdi yaccha tanūṁ tvacam naptāram ašīya. TS VI.4.1 provides a Brāhmaṇa- explanation only for mano me hārdi yaccha. Baudhāyana (IV.10) divides the above-mentioned mantra-portion into two and explains, &ldquo;with adbhyas tvau&rsquo;sadhibhyo mano me hardi yaccha the sub-offerer wipes out his hands on the sacrificial grass; with tanum tvacam putram naptāram ašīya (the sacrificer) gazes at the smoke (issuing out of the cooked cuttings of the anus of the animal in the animal-sacrifice).&rdquo; Bhaṭṭa Bhaskara on TSI.3.11 agrees to this. BhārŚSVII.21.13-14 lays down, &ldquo;with adbhyas tvau&rsquo;ṣadhibhyaḥ the Pratiprasthātṛ wipes out the smearing on the sacrificial grass; with mano me hārdi yaccha (etc.) he touches himself.&rdquo; Here the remaining formula tanum tvacam putraṁ naptāram asiya may be understood. By &lsquo;he&rsquo; it is proper to understand the Pratiprasthaṭr in consideration of the Brahmaṇa- explanation in TS VI 4.1 Bharadvaja&rsquo;s prescription for mano me hārdi yaccha is acceptable; but the subsequent portion, if presumed, cannot be applicable. ApŚS VII.26.12 generally agrees with Bharadvāja. Baudhāyana&rsquo;s employment of tanum tvacam putram naptāram asiyawhich is distinct from Bharadvaja and Apastamba is the reasonable one. Numerous other cases of this nature can be found out. The instances cited above are adequate to indicate the partial artifici- ality of the prescription of Bharadvāja and Āpastamba and their consequent posteriority. The Satyāṣāḍha Kalpasūtra and the Vaikhānasa Śrauasūtra are admittedly later than the BharSS and the ApŚS.
The Vadhula Śrautasūtra (VādhŚS) deserves consideration for ascer- taining the comparative chronology of Śrautasūtras. VādhŚS first became known to the scholarly world when W. Caland published a few parts of it in four instalments (Acta orientalia Vols. I-VI, Lugduni Batavorum 1924-28). After a long time M. Witzel shed some light on the extent and character of that text.
36 In 1993 B.B. Chaube37 published a critical edition of this Sūtra based on the manuscripts and other material available to him. Yasuke Ikari of the Kyoto University in Japan has now undertaken the project of publish- ing in Roman script yet another critical edition of this Sūtra-text. He has succeeded in securing the original manuscript of that text from Kerala. It will be published in instalments, and will probably be an improvement over the edition published earlier. This is not the place to go into the merits of the printed editions. My remarks will be confined to the contribution of the VādhŚS towards the comparative chronology of the BaudhŚS.

INTRODUCTION
XXXV
As already observed, Mahādeva, the author of commentary vaijayantī on the Satyāṣāḍha Kalpasūtra has mentioned VādhŚS as the last one among the Taittiriya Sutras. There must be some reason behind it. An examination of the mantras employed in the VādhŚS shows that the text of those mantras is at variation in many places from those in the Taittiriya texts. These variations cannot be set aside as modifications occurred in oral transmission or as scribal errors. The VādhŚS probably belonged to some branch of the Taittiriyas other than the Khāṇḍikeya to which the other Taittirīya Sūtras belong.
The character of the VadhŚS is close to that of the BaudhŚS; there is even literal agreement in many cases. Vādhūla is extensive in his prescrip- tions. He cites the mantras in extenso in his specific style. He often quotes Brāhmaṇa-passages from the Taittiriya recension-perhaps to a larger extent than Baudhayana. The Vadhūla manuscript even contains numerous Brāhmaṇa-passages, not exhaustive, which are known as anvākhyāna. One comes across deictic use of pronouns. The language is archaic. The so-called sütra-marking is not of a uniform character. There is no clear division of Praśna, Prapathaka and Anuvāka. There is also a Patala division. The beginning sutra of the next Patala is often employed as the end of the present Pațala. All these features lead to the conclusion that the VādhSS is a pravacana like the BaudhŚS.
A comparison of the contents of the BaudhSS with those of the VādhŚS shows that the two texts go parallel to a certain extent. The available VādhŚS- text has not laid down the Ekāhas, the Ahīnas and the Sattras. It is remarkable that the fourteenth Prapathaka, a short one, records the duties of the sacrificer in those rituals and also the incidental rites. In Chaube&rsquo;s edition of the VādhŚS the Agnyādheya forms the first Prapāṭhaka. All other recensions, except the Vaikhanasa Śrautasūtra, begin with the Darsa- Pūrṇamāsa in consonance with the general Yajurveda tradition. From the information supplied by Ikari about the Kerala MSS of VadhŚS it appears that the VadhSS also began with the Darŝa-Purṇamāsa.
Caland has acknowledged the close relationship between the BaudhŚS and the VadhSS. From the larger number of Brāhmaṇa-citations in the VādhŚS he had expressed the possibility of the anteriority of Vādhūla to Baudhayana. The VadhSS was known to the author or authors of the Dvaidha, the Karmânta and the Prayaścitta Sutras. There is no evidence to infer that Vādhula was known to Baudhayana the author of the main Sūtra-
xxxvi
BAUDHAYANASRAUTASŪTRA
text. 39 Like Baudhāyana, Vādhūla gives at the outset a list of things required for the performance of the ritual under discussion. A comparison of these things with those mentioned by Baudhāyana shows a little difference here and there. A clear indication of Baudhāyana&rsquo;s anteriority over Vadhula is the treatment of third Kanda of the TS known as Aupānuvākya. That Kanda has recorded such mantras and the Brāhmaṇa-portions as support mainly the mantra-and Brāhmaṇa-portions laying down the Soma-sacrifice. Baudhāyana has independently dealt with the Aupānuvākya Kāṇḍa in Praśna XIV; he has not at all touched it while prescribing the Soma-sacrifice on the basis of the principal portion of TS. This is not so with Vādhūla who, even though he is aware of the Aupānuvākya Kāṇḍa, has suitably exploited the provisions made in this Kānda side by side with the main portions.
The Agnyādheya is prescribed in Praśna II of the BaudhŚS. As already observed, the Khaṇḍikās of this Praśna are not in the proper order. The regular procedure is given in Khaṇḍikās 12-21. It is remarkable that the VādhŚS has nothing parallel to Khaṇḍikās 1-11 of the BaudhŚS except that the formulas called papmano vinidhayaḥ are recorded in the Pariseșa. The Karmānta (BaudhSS XXIV.15) has mentioned different periods at which the rite of setting the fires should commence, namely, one year before or twleve days or thirteen days or one day before, which agree with Kath. VII. 15. These options are absent in the VadhŚS. According to Baudhayana the formal choosing of all seventeen priests takes place at the setting up of fires. The other Taittirīya Sūtrakāras ask the sacrificer to choose them at the Agniṣṭoma - the proper occasion for the functioning of all of them. It is striking that the choosing of priests is not met with in any part of the available VadhSS.
In Prapathaka III of the VādhŚS Kaṇḍikās 1-10 are assigned as the yājamānawherein we find certain expiation-rites in respect of the Agnihotra and the Darsa-Purnamasa which are apparently to be performed by the sacrificer. In Prapathaka XIV there are certain expiation-rites to be observed by the sacrificer initiated for a Soma-sacrifice. Nowhere does one come across the expiation-rites to be performed by the Adhvaryu.
Prapathaka XIII of the VadhŚS is devoted to the Pravargya-rite. In all Taittiriya Sūtra-texts the expiation-rites pertaining to the Pravargya and the Avantaradīkṣā to be undergone by the sacrificer for learning by heart the Pravargya-mantras contained in the Taittiriya Aranyaka are prescribed side by side with the Pravargya-rite and the disposal of the Pravargya-implements.INTRODUCTION
xxxvii
These are absent in this Prapathaka. Prapāṭhakas VI and VII prescribe the Agniṣṭoma. While laying down the procedure of the Agnistoma and while speaking about the subsequent Soma-sacrifices, Vādhula refers to the Ukthya, Şoḍaśin and Atirātra sacrifices. A barren cow is to be offered to Mitra-Varuna as the Anubandhya animal-sacrifice after the performance of the Udayaniyeṣṭi in a Soma-sacrifice. Baudhāyana (ŚS VIII.21) has men- tioned the offering of Amikṣā as a substitute to the animal. Vādhūlā (VII.22.55) has not allowed this substitute.
BaudhŚS XV.24 prescribes the wholesale employment of the fourteen verses towards the armouring of the royal sacrificer. The verses are recorded in TS IV. 6.6 and the Brahmana is given in TBr III.9.4. It would be interesting to have a look on the employment of the relevant TS-verses - twenty in all. BaudhŚS XV.24 prescribes:
अथ यजमानं वर्मसंनहनीयाभिः संनह्यति जीमूतस्येव भवति प्रतीकमिति चतुर्दशभिर्यथारूपम् । अथ रथमुपतिष्ठते वनस्पते वीड्वङ्गो हि भूया इति तिसृभिरनुच्छन्दसम् । अथ दुन्दुभिमुपश्वासयत्युपश्वासय पृथिवीमुत द्यामिति तिसृभिरनुच्छन्दसम् ।
Thus Baudhayana asks the Adhvaryu to equip the sacrificer with the various implements and weapons while reciting the fourteen verses one by one, and then in triads. He presumes the proper understanding on the part of the Adhvaryu. VādhŚS XI. 15.56-16.14 prescribes:
वर्मसंनहनीयेनानुवाकेन यजमानं संनह्यति || जीमूतस्येव भवति प्रतीकमिति ॥
He further gives instructions to be carried out reciting each subsequent verse (ekayā) and then in triads. Thus Vādhūla prescribes the equipment of the sacrificer as prescribed in the Anuvāka; he furthermore thinks it desirable to give several directions to be carried out with the several verses. Apastamba (XX 16.4-14) does not refer to the Anuvāka in laying down the injunctions; he mentions each verse and lays down the action to be carried out with it. A comparison of the instructions given in these three Sūtra-texts shows that their attitude towards explanation is gradually modified. Vādhūla was inclined to give detailed instructions as compared to Baudhāyana. A thorough comparison of the BaudhŚS and the VadhSS will shed welcome light on their mutual relationship.
I have given these details of the VadhŚS because of its close affinity with the BaudhŚS and also because the study of the VadhŚS is still in its infancy. From this comparative study it may be concluded that Vādhula was posterior to Baudhayana the author of the main Baudhayana text. The VadhSS was
Xxxviii
BAUDHAYANASRAUTASÜTRA
composed before the composition of the Dvaidha, Karmanta and Prayaścitta sections of the BaudhŚS. Not much time passed between Baudhāyana and the composer or composers of the Dvaidha and Karmanta. Consequently the chronological difference between Baudhāyana and Vadhūla could be very little. If a definite chronology is to be attempted, I am inclined to assign the period 800 B.C. to 600 B.C. to the BaudhŚS. This span covers three steps : (i) composition of the main text of the BaudhŚS, (ii) composition of the VādhŚS, and (iii) the composition of the Dvaidha, Karmanta and Prayaścitta sections. The main part of the BaudhŚS is thus the oldest among the Kalpasūtras belonging to the Taittirīya recension.
The chronological relationship of the BaudhŚS with the Śrautasūtras belonging to the other existing recensions of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda, namely the Kāthaka, Kapisthala-Katha and the Maitrāyaṇī is a point to be consid ered. Two Śrautasūtras, the Manava and the Vārāha, belong to the Maitrāyaṇī recension; the Manava is senior to the Vārāha. The MānŚS is a Sūtra-text, not a pravacana. It therefore cannot be older than the BaudhŚS; it is junior to the latter. The Maitrāyaṇī recension was of course in need of a Śrautasūtra. Even though the Maitrāyaṇīya ritualists must have found some device for setting their ritual in order, it seems the actual Sütra-composition was undertaken at a rather late date.

The Kathaka Śrautasūtra (KāṭhŚS) is unfortunately lost. It comprised thirtynine Adhyāyas, vide Devapāla&rsquo;s commentary on the Laugākṣi (Kāṭhaka) Gṛhyasūtra. Suryakānta has published in his Kāṭhakasaṁkalana11 extracts from the Kathaka Brāhmaṇa collected from manuscript-collections pre- served in Lahore, and from Devapāla&rsquo;s commentary on the Laugākṣi Gṛhyasūtra; those from the KāthŚS-one collected from a manuscript and many others from the commentaries by Karka and Devayājñika on the KatyŚS (edited by A. Weber, Berlin 1859), and a few quotations from the Crhyasutra of the Kathakas collected from various sources. The first among the Śrautasūtra-passages lays down the group of Divaḥ Śyeni and Apāghā Istis. The passage is said to have formed the fourth Patala (that is, Kaṇḍikā forming part of some Adhyāya). It is striking that citations from the KāthŚS composed in north-western India have been reproduced by the commenta- tors of the KatyŚS which was composed in the north-eastern part. Probably some followers of the Kāṭhaka school had migrated towards the north-east with whom the Vājasaneyins came into contact. Sometimes Katha and Maitra (=Maitrāyaṇīya) passages are cited together. The Kathaka Śrautasūtra is so
INTRODUCTION
xxxix
called because it belongs to the Kathaka recension. The author of the Kathaka Gṛhyasūtra was Laugākṣi. Even though Karka and Devayājñika have cited in their commentaries passages from the KāṭhŚS mostly under the designation ‘Katha&rsquo; or &lsquo;Kāthaka&rsquo;, at about a dozen places they have quoted under the name &lsquo;Laugakṣi&rsquo;. It may therefore be said that Laugākṣi was the name of the author of the KāthSS also.
42
It would rather be hasty to assess the character of the KāṭhŚS as a whole on the basis of only a few available extracts. The TBr together with the TÃ deals with the Kāṭhaka citis, and the mantra and Brāhmaṇa for the Divaḥ Śyeni and Apāghā Iṣṭis are recorded in TBr III.12.1-4. The Taittiriya Śrautasütras have referred to these Istis. Thus the Taittiriyas have from the very beginning borrowed certain ritual - elements from the Kathakas. A study of all the KathŚS - passages so laboriously collected by Suryakānta shows that the Sūtrakāra has described the ritualistic items in a detailed manner. He has not adopted the sutra - style; he is a pravacanakāra. Hence the Śrautasūtra must have been composed in very old days. There are certain indications showing the archaic language and archaic ritualistic elements. There is deictic use of demonstrative pronouns. An interesting point arises out of the definition of prakrama. A long KāthŚS - passage is cited in the commentary on the KatyŚS while prescribing the measuring of the Mahāvedi for the Agnistoma. The measuring of the Mahāvedi is prescribed in detail, and while doing so the Sútrakāra gives the definition of prakrama and pada: tripadaḥ prakramo&rsquo;rdhacaturthapado vā padam pañcadašāngulam dvādaśāngulam vā (Kāṭhakasaṁkalana p.16, KātyŚS edn. p. 687). Here two things are worthy of attention: firstly, the Sūtrakāra, while prescribing the measuring also gives the definition of prakrama and of pada. Here is the pravacana style of speaking all things together. While prescribing the measuring of the Mahāvedi (VI.22) Baudhāyana has not given the definition of prakrama; he simply uses that word. In Baudh. ŚulbaS (1.5) he has given the definition. Here Kāthaka&rsquo;s pravacana style seems to be more prominent than that of Baudhayana. Secondly, while Baudhāyana defines a prakrama as dvipada, Kāthaka defines it as tripada and even ardhacaturthapadai.e. three and half padas. It may be observed that the longer prakrama of Kathaka points to an older period. According to Baudhāyana (SuS.1.9) a pada consists of fifteen angulas while Kathaka allows the option of fifteen or twleve.
A few other points may be noted: the Caturmasya sacrifices to be completed consecutively in five days as an option are attributed to Katha
xl
BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA
(p.12, KātyŚS edn p. 554). These are not mentioned in the BaudhŚS main text nor in the Karmanta. The Anugrahika (Parisiṣṭa) of the ManŚS has mentioned it. In the sūtra for Divah Syeni the Sūtrakāra has given two Ślokas, and in that for the Apagha one Śloka. Parallel construction is found in BaudhŚS Prāyaścitta. Such features pointing to a late date may perhaps be the additions made by some follower of the Kāṭhaka school in course of time. This should however not speak against the conclusion of the Kāṭhaka main Sūtra-text being a pravacana and therefore being as old as, if not earlier than, the BaudhŚS. Just as Baudhayana may be said to have been the first teacher setting the Taittirīya rituals in order immediately after the Brāhmaṇa period, similarly Kāṭhaka (Laugākṣi) may be said to have been the first teacher setting the Kathaka rituals in order.
The comparative chronology of the BaudhŚS, the VadhŚS, the MānŚS and the KāthSS is noteworthy.
The Kapisthala-Katha sub-recension does not seem to possess an inde- pendent Śrautasūtra.
9. The Home of the Baudhayaniyas
Since the last few centuries the followers of the Baudhayana school have been the inhabitants of Karnataka and Kerala. These regions should how- ever not be understood as their original home. Baudhāyana who may be regarded as the first teacher who, immediately after the Brāhmaṇa-period, set the Taittiriya rituals to order in the pravacana form, must have lived in the north-western parts of India where the Taittiriya and all other recensions of the Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda took their root and flourished. We find the following geographical references in the BaudhŚS43: āraṭṭaVIII.13; Karaskara XVIII.13; Kalinga II.3; XVIII. 13; Kāśīvideha XVIII.44; Kurukṣetra XVIII.45; kurupañcāla XVIII.44, Kurubrahman XVIII.26; khāṇḍavaprasthaXVII.18, gāndhāra XVIII.13; 44; pañcāla XVIII.25; plākṣa prasravaṇa XVI.29; 30; bisavatī (pl) XVIII. 45; mahāvarṣa II.3; mūjavat II.3 VI.14; varṣiṣthiya prastha XVIII.49; videha II.3; saphāla XVIII.13; sarasvati (river) XII.8; XVI.29; XXII.18; suvarņasavanī XVIII.45; sauvîra XVIII.13.
Some of these localities and places were most probably intimately known to Baudhayana or his descendants; the others were known merely by hearsay. There was close contact of the Taittiriyas and therefore of Baudhāyana with the followers of the Kathaka** and the Maitrāyaṇī recensions which flourished in the Panjab and the other north-western parts. There is also
44
INTRODUCTION
xli
evidence (e.g. the Kāthaka citis) which shows that Baudhayana was in the neighbourhood of the Kathakas. The river Sarasvati which was flowing in his neighbourhood was held in respect (BaudhŚS XII.8) as we find also in TBr (1.7.5). It would therefore be proper to hold that Baudhāyana was living in the Panjab. It is not possible to restrict the region any more.
45
Suryakanta15 has expressed his displeasure over the dominent position assigned by scholars of cultural history of ancient India to the Apastambas and Baudhayanas setting aside the rightful claim of the Kāṭhaka recension as representing the oldest Yajurvedic ritual-tradition. He has further deemed the so-called dominant position of the Apastambas and Baudhayanas as “a deliberate attempt at misrepresentation.&rdquo; It may, however, be observed that recent researches have proved that the original home of the Apastambas and Baudhayanas was in northern India, not in southern India. Therefore there is no question of any dominance. The Kathas, even though they established colonies in eastern and central India as the epigraphical evidence shows, maintained their position in the Panjab and Kashmir. Due to frequent political unrest they received a severe setback in their main land and their colonies outside also vanished. The Baudhāyanas and the Āpastambas could maintain their traditions because they migrated towards south India-the area which was politically peaceful. Anyway the disappearance of the KathŚS is a great loss to the Vedic literature and to the history of the ritualistic religion.
The Vadhūlas may have been living on the eastern border of the regions occupied by the Baudhayanins. Since a very long historical period the Baudhayanins left their land. Why they left, when they left, under which conditions they left&ndash;all these questions remain without any answer under the present state of our knowledge of the economic and cultural conditions of northern India in ancient times. Those of the Baudhayaniyas who chose to stick to their places possibly adopted a different Vedic school-Kāṭhaka or Maitrāyaṇī.
Baudhayanins have been living in Karnataka at least for the last six centuries. Sāyaṇa the well-known commentator of several Vedic texts lived at Vijayanagar in Karnataka in the fourteenth century A.D. He was a follower of the Baudhayana school. In the entire northern India no follower of the Taittiriya recension has been living since the last few centuries. The ritual- istic tradition indicates the association of certain Vedic schools in the various regions. The performance of a Soma-sacrifice-the principal ritual-neces- sitates the collaboration of a Baudhayanin, an Asvalayanin and a Kauthumin.

BAUDHAYANAŚRAUTASŪTRA
The tradition was that a Rgvedin of the Aśvalāyana school should have as the Adhvaryu a follower of the Baudhāyana school. In several religious tracts composed in the medieval period the prominence of the Baudhāyana school in the field of religious life is keenly felt. The supremacy of the Baudhayanins was maintained in Maharashtra where the Aśvalāyanins lived in large numbers for many centuries. Later on the Apastambins from Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh came in contact with the Maharashtrians. The result was that an Äśvalāyanin was allowed to have an Apastambin as his Adhvaryu provided a matrimonial relationship had been established.
Followers of the various Vedic schools have been living in different parts of India. The prevalence of the different Vedic schools in historical period has been traced; and this history has been helpful in compiling the history of the Vedic literature and culture. The efforts need to be continued further. The history of each Vedic school prevailing at present in the specific region should be traced to the place where it took its roots with the help of the literary and historical records and the tradition which is fortunately main- tained even to a small extent in spite of the social and economic revolution. Such a history, if compiled, will be a veritable source for the social and cultural history of India.

FOOTNOTES
The name Baudhāyana is spelt in two ways. In some manuscripts it is written as Baudhāyanawhile in many others, particularly written in Karnataka and the adjoining regions where the Baudhayana school flourished in the historical period, it is written as Bodhayana. I had therefore resorted to that spelling so far. Gramnatically, however, the suffix ayana affixed to the word budhawith the meaning of gotrāpatyawould involve the vṛddhi of the initial vowel. Hence it is reasonable to read the word as Baudhāyana. cf. W. Caland, &ldquo;Über das rituelle Sūtra des Baudhāyana”, Abhandlungen für die Kunde des Morgenlāndes Band XII No. 1, Leipzig 1903, pp. 12-13. It is further to be noted that Bodhāyana is Prakṛtisation of Baudhāyana.

The other Śrautasütras which claim the character of a pravacana are the Vādhūla Śrautasūtra belonging to the Taittiriya recension, the Jaiminiya Śrautasūtra belong- ing to the Jaiminiya recension of the Samaveda, and the Kathaka Śrautasūtra. e.g. XX.19; Duayor homa iti cf. III.4; XX.10: patnyām avidyamānāyām; XX.8: carumukheşʊ iti, XX.13; abhikrāmaṁ juhotī’ti; XX.13: pañcamasyā’vadānasyā &lsquo;bhivṛddhyā iti etc. The first three items of Dvaidha in the Pasúbandha section do not speak about the Nirüḍhapaśu; they deal with the optional animal-sacrifices. The topic sphyena&rsquo;gnïdhro nighnann anveti hotuḥ padāni&rsquo;ti XX.26 is not traced to the original Sūtra. The topic ašiḥṣu iti XXIII.8 is not traced to the main text, Dvaidha XXIII. 19 the last Khandikā of the Dvaidhasutra lays down the Dvaidhasūtra for the Sarvatomukha sacrifice; it is found in some manuscripts as a separate folio. The main text has not prescribed this sacrifice. Its position even in the Dvaidha is insecure. Kesavasvamin has reproduced this Khandika in his prayogasara in extenso. The Dvaidha on the Sarvatomukha has recorded the views of Baudhayana, Śālīki, Aupamanyava, Gautama, Maudgalya and Añjigavi. When there is no main text for the Sarvatomukha, what was the source for the various topics selected for the Dvaidha? And how should one trust the genuinenss of the different views attributed to the Acaryas?
Sāvitra offerings are prescribed in the Vajapeya sacrifice vide TBr 1.3.5.1: sāvitrāṇi juhoti karmaṇaḥ karmaṇaḥ purastāt. While Baudhāyana enumerates seventeen occa- sions for Sāvitra offerings-fourteen prior to the pressing day and three on the pressing day, Śāliki prescribes only three offerings on the pressing day.
One reads in XXVIII.8 āʼmāvāsyasya kālād iti vyākhyātaḥ. This refers to ā’māvāsyasya kālāt paurṇamāsasya kālo nā’tîyāt etc. XXVIII.12. It is difficult to explain the disturbed order of the text.

Incidentally it may be noted that a few lines in BaudhŚS VI,8 read like the Karmanta and those in BaudhŚS VII.4 read like Dvaidha,
15. The formulas pāpmano vinidhayaḥ recorded in the Prapathaka XV (Pariseṣa) of the Vādhūla Śrautasūtra (pp. 367-368) are rather different. The Pariseșa also records the formulas to be recited by the sacrificer at the various rituals.
16. In the Katyāyana Śrautasūtra the Pravargya chapter is the last one (XXVI). In the Satyaṣāḍha Kalpasūtra the Pravargya comes at the end of the Śrauta portion (XXIV). Similarly in the Vadhula Śrautasūtra (Prapathaka XIII). In the Bharadvāja Śrautasūtra it is conveniently inserted as Praśna XI into the Praśnas laying down the Agnistoma (cf. Intro. p. Ixxvi). Äpastamba and Vaikhānasa have attached the Pravargya to the Agnistoma for convenience. The Mānava Srautasūtra (new edn., Delhi 2001) has not attached the Pravargya to the Agnistoma.

Besides the direct reference to Vādhūlaka in BaudhŚS XXIX.1, one may refer to the Işti to be performed in connection with the Animal-sacrifice (BaudhŚS XX.25; VādhSS V.1.17-18) and the optional offerings to Rākā and Sinivālī in the Darsa- Pūrṇamāsa (BaudhSS XXIV.29; VadhŚS II.12.44-48). B.B. Chaube has attempted (Intro. pp. 60-61) to show the anteriority of Vādhūla to Baudhāyana: There are two cases where Vādhula has used words which may be said to have been comparatively older, Vādhūla is one of the Pravara-names mentioned in the Baudhayana Pravarasŭtra.

44. Suryakanta has made an attempt in his Introduction to the Kāthakasaṁkalana to equate the Kathas with the Hattis or Hittites, the Khata or Kheta of the Egyptian monuments, Khatta or Khate of the Assyrians and Kheta or Khitti of the Hebrews. His equations are however too fanciful, based on very meagre evidence. It is indeed hard to believe that the name of one of the Vedic schools, namely, Katha, was accepted for the entire community of the original region of the Kathas and that the people of that region migrated to several other parts of the world.

CHAPTER-I
FULL-MOON AND NEW-MOON SACRIFICES
1.1
(One who) is going to perform a sacrifice with the oblation pertaining to the new- moon or full-moon, should arrange for the curdling agent beforehand-one day or two days according to the season. Now indeed the Brahmana goes: &ldquo;He curdles it with curds in order to characterise it with Indra; he further curdles it with the remnants of Agnihotra-oblation for the continuity of sacrifice.&rdquo; (The sacrificer) adds fuel to the sacred fires after ascertaining the disappearance of the moon or after having known it to be full. He puts three sticks on the Garhapatya fire, three on the Anvāhāryapacana fire and three on the Ahavaniya fire. They cleanse around (the fire-places) and effect the form (of the Vihara suitable) to the (day) preceding the principal day.
&ldquo;3
the
Now for this (sacrificer) who has adopted vow (the Adhvaryu) restraining his speech goes towards the east or north for (bringing) a twig of Butea frondosa,2 or (he may go) towards that direction where he thinks he may get at it. With the formula &ldquo;For food thee, for strength thee,&rdquo; he cuts that twig which lies towards the east or north, which has many leaves, many smaller twigs and whose tip is not dried up. With the formula, &ldquo;You are movers; you are approachers,*** he drives away calves. Then he impels their mothers with the formula, &ldquo;May god Savity lead you for the highest deed. O (cows who are) not to be killed, do you swell the share of gods, O strong ones, full of milk, having offspring, free from sickness, from disease. Let He not the thief, the evil-doer have control over you; let Rudra&rsquo;s dart avoid you. gazes at the sacrificer with the formula, &ldquo;Be firm and numerous with this lord of cattle.&rdquo; With the formula, &ldquo;Do thou guard the sacrificer&rsquo;s cattle,&rdquo; he moves around the twig along the front of the Ahavanīya, brings in by the eastern door and fixes it on the cart standing to the rear of the Garhapatya fire or in the northern half of the (Garhapatya) fire-chamber. This is if the sacrificer is going to offer the Samnayya. If he is not going to offer Sāṁnāyya (the fetching of ) sacrificial grass follows immediately.

Now standing to the rear of the Garhapatya, (the Adhvaryu) takes up either a sickle or a horse-rib with the formula, &ldquo;I take up thee in the impulse of god Savitr with the arms of Asvins, with the hands of Puṣan.&rdquo; After having taken it, he recites over it the formula, &ldquo;Thou art the procurer of cows through the sacrifice.&rdquo; He heats it on the Garhapatya with the formula, &ldquo;Rakṣas is burnt, enemies are burnt&rdquo; recited thrice. Then he goes towards the Ahavaniya with the formula, &ldquo;this wise1 (sickle) has gone towards the sacrificial grass (made by Manu chisled with food). The wise fetch from in front the delightful (sacrificial grass) for the gods.&rdquo; With the formula, &ldquo;For depositing the sacrificial grass here&rdquo; he gazes at the Vedi. Then he proceeds towards that direction towards which he may think he would procure sacrificial grass. With the formula, &ldquo;You are measured out for gods&rdquo; he catches hold of darbha-cluster which he thinks adequate for the Prastara. He cleanses it upwards with the formula, &ldquo;Thou are grown-up with rains.&rdquo; He applies the sickle (to the cluster) with the formula, &ldquo;O divine sacrificial grass, may I not hit thee along nor across; may I hit thy joint.&rdquo; He cuts them with the formula, &ldquo;May I, thy cutter, not be ruined.&rdquo; He touches the stumps of the cluster with the formula, “O divine sacrifical grass, do thou grow in a hundred shoots.&rdquo; He touches himself with the formula, &ldquo;May we grow in a thousand shoots.&ldquo;10 He fully cuts the cluster. Having turned it into the Prastara, he puts down the same with the formula, &ldquo;Guard (us) from the contact with earth.&ldquo;11 Subsequently he cuts handfuls in odd number

KS and MS read goșad instead of ghoṣad. Sāyaṇa renders ghosad as wealth. Bhaya Bhaskara derives it from Vghus (present participle) with the sense &ldquo;announcer&rdquo;. P.-E. Dumont deems the word originally as gosadh (transfer of aspiration) (JAOS75, pp. 117- 118). T. Burrow (JAOS 76, pp. 185-186 considers the word really to be go-sad. The explanation of this formula given in TBr III. 2.2.2 yajamāna eva rayim dadhāti supports Dumont&rsquo;s explanation.

Then after having made a cord in three strands, he twists it by the left with the formula, &ldquo;Thou art the girdle of Aditi.

Other Sūtrakāras have included it in the rites to be performed by the Adhvaryu, because according to them the preparatory rites of the Piņḍapitṛyajña are to be performed by the Adhvaryu; the sacrificer later on appears on the scene and makes the offerings.

He cuts off the lower portion of the twig and places the (lower) thick part as the fire-stirring stick to the rear of the Garhapatya. He measures out the remaining portion one span in length, inserts on both ends pieces of darbha-blades and prepares the Śākhāpavitra in three strands with the verse, &ldquo;The three-stranded darbha-blade fixed with the Palasa-twig is this much (that is) one span in length. May that strainer render the oblation (that is) the milk most purifying in my sacrifice.&rdquo; After the Agnihotra has been offered in the evening, the Adhvaryu spreads grassblades towards the north of the Garhapatya and deposits on them four implements, namely, milking pot, purifying darbha-blades and two vessels for boiling Sāṁnāyya-milk.

already strewn around, he strews around the Ahavaniya itself, first towards the east, then south, the west and the north. Similarly, he strews around the Anvāhāryapacana; similarly Garhapatya. Having strewn darbha-blades in front of the Garhapatya, he places upon them the sacrificial implements in pairs upside down-the wooden sword, potsherds, Agnihotra - ladle, winnowing basket, skin of black antelope, yoke- halter, mortar, pestle, lower crushing stone, upper crushing stone, Juhū ladle, Upabhṛt-ladle, spoon, Dhruva - ladle, Prāśitra-pot, Iḍā-pot, corn-stirring stick, pan for pouring flour, goblet for Praṇītā-waters, vessel for clarified butter, Veda, wooden trough (for placing oblations), yoke-halter, cuttings of Veda, fire-stirring stick, cuttings of faggot, vessel for cooking Anvāhārya-rice, and vessel for boiling water. Having arranged other implements also in pairs, and having seated the Brahman towards the south, he strews the straight central line from the Gārhapatya upto the Ahavaniya with the formula, &ldquo;Thou art the continuity of the sacrifice; I spread thee for the continuity of the sacrifice, for the continuity of sacrifice I spread thee.&rdquo; Then he prepares out of the sacrificial grass two strainers-one span in length, equal in size, with unbroken tips, not cut by a nail, with the formula, &ldquo;May these, Prāņa and Apāna move swelling the parts of sacrifice from all sides and cleansing the oblation.&rdquo; He then cleanses them with water with the formula, &ldquo;You are the strainers, you belong to Visnu, you are worthy of sacrifice; you are purified by wind; you are purified by Visņu&rsquo;s mind, you are purifiers of sacrifice.&rdquo;

Then after having sat down to the north of the Gārhapatya, he asks for a bronze vessel or a wooden goblet for carrying forth Praṇītā-waters. While pouring water in it across the strainer, he says, &ldquo;O Brahman, I shall carry forth waters; O sacrificer, do you restrain speech.&rdquo; Impelled, holding (the bronze vesel or goblet) at the level of the nose, having carried forth without sprinkling down, having placed on the darbha-grass to the north of the Āhavaniya, having covered (the vessel of goblet) with darbha-blades,&rdquo; having turned by the right, having moved towards the west, he takes up the Agnihotra-ladle with his right hand and the winnowing basket with the left one with the formula for accomplishment thee.&rdquo; He heats (them) over the Garhapatya with the formula, &ldquo;The Rakṣas is burnt, the evil spirits are burnt&rdquo;? recited three times.

With the verse- half, &ldquo;Gods promoted the elevation, the depression and the power of my prayer,&rdquo; he moves the Juhu eastwards. With the verse-half, &ldquo;Do you, O Indra-Agni, scatter my foes on all sides,&rdquo; he discards the Upabhṛt towards the west. With the Juhu he besmears the enclosing sticks-the middle one with &ldquo;For Vasus thee&rdquo;, the southern one with &ldquo;For Rudras thee&rdquo;, the northern one with &ldquo;For Adityas thee.&rdquo; Having applied water to the Upabhṛt and having placed the ladles at their places, he dips the Prastara into the ladle-with &ldquo;Licking the besmeared.&rdquo; The tips into the Juhu, with &ldquo;Let the birds go asunder&rdquo; the middle portion into the Upabhṛt and with “May I not brush the offspring and the womb,&rdquo; the roots into the Dhruvā. Having taken out a darbha-blade from the Prastara, he puts it into the Juhu. Then he makes (the Agnidhra) announce, &ldquo;Do you announce&rdquo; &ldquo;Let it be announced&rdquo; (so the Agnidhra) (and asks the Hotr to recite the Suktavāka with the formula) &ldquo;The divine Hotrs have been beseeched for the felicitous pronouncement; the human (Hotṛ) is be- queathed to recite the Sūktavāka; (O Hotṛ) do you pronounce the Sukta.&rdquo; Holding above, he moves it eastwards, he does not push so as to let the tip beyond the Ahavaniya; he does not let it backwards, does not push (into the embers); does not let go on all sides; lifts it up with the formula, “May the waters and plants swell, you are speckled mares of Maruts; do thou go to the sun; impel the rain from there.&rsquo;

He gazes at the Ägnīdhra, “O Agnidh.” To him says the Agnidhra, “Do you converse.&rdquo; &ldquo;Is it gone?&rdquo; inquires the Adhvaryu, &ldquo;It is gone,&rdquo; replies the Agnidhra. &ldquo;Do thou announce,&rdquo; says the Adhvaryu, &ldquo;Let it be heard,&rdquo; says the Agnidhra. “Say this,&rdquo; says the Adhvaryu, &ldquo;Do you throw (the darbha-blade taken out of the Prastara),&rdquo; says the Agnidhra. (The Adhvaryu) throws it. (The Adhvaryu gives out the call to the Hotṛ), &ldquo;Hail to the divine Hours, happiness to the human Hotrs; Do you, O Hotr, recite the samyor formula.&rdquo; Having stood up, he prays to the Ahavaniya

enclosed chamber. Taking four spoonfuls of clarified butter he says loudly, “Do you recite the puronuvākyā” (in low tone) &ldquo;for Gṛhapati Agni.” At the Vasat-utterance he makes the offering in the eastern half of the northern half beyond the earlier offerings. Having gone beyond in front of the Hotṛ, he anoints twice the (fore) finger of the Hotṛ. The latter consumes it by smelling. He puts Iḍã on the (Hotṛ&rsquo;s) hand in four portions of clarified butter. The Adhvaryu and the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife touch (the Hotṛ). After the Iḍa has been invoked, he imparts Iḍā to the Agnidhra in six portions. (The Hotṛ and the Agnidhra) consume the Iḍa. They sprinkle
themselves.

Having taken up four spoonfuls in the ladle and turning by the left, he offers an expiation on the Anvāhāryapacana fire with the verse, &ldquo;I unite the drops, big and small, which have stuck up in the mortar, to the pestle, to the winnowing basket, on the lower crushing stone and to the potsherd. May Viśve Devas approve of this oblation. The many drops which are in the sacrifice-I offer them all on the fire well offered and well put&rdquo; svāhā.&rdquo; Having taken up another four spoonfuls and having put the cuttings of faggot on the Anvāhāryapacana itself and having poured the chaff of grains, he offers the oblation of chaff of grains with the formula, &ldquo;O Agni, with life unhurt, with not-cool body, guard me this day from the sky, guard me from bondage, guard me from error in sacrifice, guard from evil food, guard from ill deed; render our food poisonless; render our seat comfortably occupiable, svāhā.”16
Having returned by the same route by which he had gone and having handed over the Veda to the Hotr, he unties the girdle round the waist of the sacrificer&rsquo;swife with the verse, &ldquo;I loosen this bond of Varuna which Savity, the kindly, has bound. And with birth-place of the erector, in the place of good action, I make it pleasant for me with my husband.&ldquo;17 Having put the girdle into her folded hands, he empties a pot filled with water with the verse, &ldquo;O Agni, I become united with life, and offspring, and with splendour more and more with my husband as wife. May my spirit be united with my body.&ldquo;18 He cleanses his face with the verse, &ldquo;The honey which, O Sarasvati, thou hast in water, in the cattle and in the horses, with that honey, O Sarasvati, do thou strong, besmear my mouth. 19 He pours down the water. &ldquo;Having rendered the form of Avabhṛtha he gets up.&rdquo; So says the Brāhmaṇa.

Thou art swift, O Agni, and free from censure. Really thou art swift, supported by swift, thou carriest oblation swiftly, swift do thou grant us remedy, Svāhā.

THE SETTING UP OF THE SACRED FIRES
II.1

Now the pronouncement (of the setting up of the sacred fires). It is said in the pro- Brāhmaṇa, “At the commencement of a sacrifice (the sacrificer) should nounce his desire for the sacrifice; at the commencement of a rite the desire for the rite.&rdquo; Having spread darbha-blades with their tuft towards the east, the sacrificer, having sat on them with his face towards the east, murmurs the verses, &ldquo;Those which flow from the front, from above, and from all sides, with those which have rays as the strainer, I commence the sacrifice, the faith-O gods, the knowers of path, do you secure the path for the sacrifice. Let the sacrifice be arranged from the wind through the god, the lord of mind,&ldquo;2 “O Śraddhã, do thou come. I invoke thee with truth.&rdquo; He expresses his intention with the verses,&rdquo; (O Indra), I place thee in front for intention, for desire, for prosperity, for immortal life. The wise employ their mind for obtaining protection and prosperity through the intention and desire for Indra. I place the goddess governing the intention before my mind. May the goddess of sacrifice (i.e. the intention) be inclined to listen to my call. Whatever desire I entertain, may that desire deep in my heart be fulfilled.
up
He expresses the intention three times in mind, three times loudly. In the setting up of fires (he should express the intention), &ldquo;Desiring all things I shall set the fires.&rdquo; In the Full-moon and New-moon sacrifices, &ldquo;Desiring heaven I shall perform the Full-moon and New-moon sacrifices.&rdquo; In the Căturmāsya sacrifices, &ldquo;Desiring heaven, I shall perform the Caturmasya sacrifices.&rdquo; In a Soma-sacrifice &ldquo;Desiring heaven I shall perform a Soma-sacrifice.&rdquo; In the Agnicayana, “Desiring heaven, I shall pile up the fire-altar.&rdquo; In an Ahīna or an Ahargana sacrifice (he should express that intention) for the fulfilment of which he may be performing the sacrifice. (He should further say), &ldquo;May that sacrificial performance succeed, may it be accomplished, may my desire be fulfilled.&rdquo; The response of the priests should be, &ldquo;May your sacrificial performance succeed, may it be accomplished, may your desire be fulfilled.&rdquo; &ldquo;May it be so&rdquo;, is the reply.
II.2
Now he begs the sacrificial place to the priests. To the Adhvaryu, “O Adhvaryu, do you give me the sacrificial place.&rdquo; (He says), “God Aditya is the divine Adhvaryu,

may he grant you the sacrificial place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; is the reply. To the Brahman, &ldquo;O Brahman, do you give me the sacrificial place.&rdquo; (He says) &ldquo;God Candramas is the divine Brahman; may he give you the sacrificial place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; is the reply. To the Hotṛ, &ldquo;O Hotṛ, Do you give me the sacrificial place.&rdquo; (He says), &ldquo;God Agni is the divine Hotṛ, may he give you the sacrificial place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; is the reply. To the Udgāt &ldquo;O Udgātṛ, do you give me the sacrificial place.&rdquo; (He says) &ldquo;God Parjanya is the divine Udgātṛ; may he give you the sacrificial place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; is the reply. To the Sadasya, &ldquo;O Sadasya, do you give me the sacrificial place.&rdquo; &ldquo;God Akasa is the divine Sadasya; may he give you the sacrificial place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it so&rdquo; is the reply. To the Hotrakas, &ldquo;O Hotrakas, do you give me the sacrificial place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Goddesses waters are the divine Hotrāśamsins; may they give you the sacrificial place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; is the reply. To the Camasādhvaryus, “O Camasādhvaryus, do you give me the sacrificial place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Gods Raśmis are the divine Camasādhvaryus; may they give you the sacrificial place.&rdquo; &ldquo;Be it so,” is the reply.
Or he may not beg for the sacrificial place. At the outset, having bathed in holy water, having come up, having worn a new garment, clean, pious, purified, fit for sacrifice, sinless, remaining celibate, working in accord with his colleagues, keep- ing in view the rites upto the fourth rite he should direct the rites as prescribed in the Veda. Facing the east, and wearing the cord suitable to a sacrifice he performs the rites pertaining to gods as ending either towards the east or north and turning by the right. Facing the south and with his cord on the right shoulder, he performs the rites pertaining to the Pitrs turning by the left. Standing, seated or bent as the case may be. The Samaveda Brāhmaṇa&rsquo; (says), &ldquo;As is the right palm, so is the sacrificial place. As is the left one, so is the place for offering to Pitrs. As is the place for Pitrs, so is the place of obsequies. As is the place for obsequies, so is the place for Işti, animal-sacrifice and a Soma-sacrifice to be performed for exorcistic purposes. The sacrificial place should basically be such as has water in the east and also be such in whose front another sacrificial place may not be obtained. One should leave towards the north (such piece of land) as may be sufficient for (another) sacrificial place.

Now the formal choosing of the officiating priests. It is said in the Brāhmaṇa: (Only such) brahmanas (should be chosen as) priests as are endowed with (noble) parentage, Gotra, learning and character, as have no bodily deficiency, as do not</p>

have scars on three limbs,&rsquo; have not crossed a moat, have not crossed the border (of the country), were not born in border-region and have studied the Veda. (He should choose persons) excluding one who plies a plough, one who trades in wool, one who is the son of an appointed daughter, one who was begotten by another person, one who was in the womb of a woman at her marriage, one who was born of an unmarried daughter, one who is a posthumous child or who has two Pravaras. The Adhvaryu should be one belonging to the Angirasa Gotra, the Brahman to the Vasisthagotra, the Hotṛ to the Viśvāmitra gotra, the Udgātṛ to the Ayasya gotra, and the Sadasya to the Kauṣitaka gotra. Other priests may be belonging to the Bhrgu or Angirasa gotra. Some teachers think that family, character and learning should be the criteria. If one happens to choose such persons, he should choose only such as do not have any bodily deficiency. One should choose such person as the Adhvaryu who does not have ugly nails; Brahman who does not suffer from leprosy, Hotṛ who does not have broken teeth or torn lips, Udgātṛ who does not have protruding teeth, Sadasya who does not have a skin-disease. The Pratiprasthātṛ, Nestr and Unnetṛ are Adhvaryu&rsquo;s assistants; Brāhmaṇācchamisin, Ägnīdhra and Potṛ are Brahman&rsquo;s assistants; Maitrāvaruṇa, Acchāvāka and Grāvastut are Hotṛ&rsquo;s assistants; Prastotr, Pratihartṛ and Subrahmanya are Udgātṛ&rsquo;s assistants. Abhigara, Dhruvagopa and Samś rāva are Sadasya&rsquo;s assistants. They are independent; some say they are not. There are ten or eleven Camasādhvaryus. Their services are obtained by giving other Dakṣinās. So is it said.
For the Agnihotra sacrifice there is only one priest. In the Full-moon and New- moon sacrifices there are four-Adhvaryu, Brahman, Hotṛ and Ägnīdhra. In the Caturmāsyas the Pratiprasthātṛ is the fifth. In the animal-sacrifice the Maitrāvaruna is the sixth. All (the above-mentioned are) in a Soma-sacrifice. (The sacrificer) chooses them at each performance. Having caught hold of each one he should address him, “I, N.N., approach you for Adhvaryava; do you cause me to sacrifice,&rdquo; &ldquo;&hellip;for Udgātr&rsquo;s for Hotṛ&rsquo;s function &ldquo;&hellip; for Brahman&rsquo;s function function&hellip;.&rdquo;. &lsquo;&hellip;. for Sadasya&rsquo;s function&hellip;..&rdquo; Some say that there is no Sadasya. (He chooses) the Hotrakas for their respective functions. Some say that he should not choose the Hotrakas. The Hotrakas and Camasādhvaryus are subordinate to the respective chief priest. Of all the priests the Adhvaryu is appointed first. The Saman- chanting (at a Soma-sacrifice) is to be introduced by him.2

<dt>On the shoulder caused by the use of bow, on the arms caused by wrestling and on the neck caused by fight with elephants.</dt>
<dt>Thus the Saman-chanting in Soma-sacrifice depends upon him. The Sastra-reciting following the Rgveda succeeds the Saman-chanting. So the Adhvaryu precedes all.</dt>

<dt>After having gone out towards the north by the way between the altar and the rubbish-heap, he (and others) go towards that direction where the materials are arranged for him. Or all the materials are arranged towards the north of the hall. Or he collects them within the altar with the respective mantras one by one in the order indicated by the mantras, ending towards the east. Having collected the sand with the verse, &ldquo;The manifestation of Vaiśvānara, the rubbish may enter upon us on this earth with pleasure,&rdquo; he deposits it. Similarly, having collected each succeeding substance with each succeeding mantra, he deposits it. Saline earth, sand, earth carved out by a rat, earth from an ant-hill, earth from dried pond, earth dug out by a hog, lotus-leaf and gravel-these are eight earthly substances. With the succeed- ing mantra he brings six particles of gold. The substances of vegetable kingdom (should be procured) with the mantras pertaining to herbs. He brings twigs which are wet, with leaves, with sprouts, as long as a span and with their tips not dried up. Or he may procure as many as become available. A twig of Butea frondosa with two (mantras). He brings three fire-sticks of a conspicuous tree of Ficus religiosa, wet, with leaves, with sprouts, as long as a span and with undried tips with the verse, &ldquo;You are collected from a conspicuous Asvattha tree, great ones and with your body consecrated equal to Prajapati, the mouth of sacrifice, three and coupled with three-fold (fire) for proceation.&rdquo; He procures a web of Muñja grass with the formula, “O Agni, I procure here thy lustrous body which has entered into plants.&rsquo;</dt>

<dt>Then he procures for him (the sacrificer) two kindling woods-(the lower one) of Ficus religiosa grown or not grown upon a Sami-tree, four angulas high, twelve angulas broad and sixteen angulas long, or a square of span and four angulas high. On the upper side, in regular order in lower part a generating place with a slope towards the west is carved out. An upper kindling wood of the same size. He brings them with the verses, &ldquo;I collect the sacrificial body of Agni born of the oblation carrying Asvattha tree for generating fire having peaceful womb and born of Sami. The Asvattha grown on Śami which has grown together with thee (O kindling wood) I carry it for thee with a prayer together with the sacrificial signs.&rsquo; He again puts right the substances well procured with the verse, “Do thou, whom</dt>

<dt>Now indeed (the Brāhmaṇa) goes, &ldquo;Indra, having killed Vṛtra and having defeated the Asuras, returned on the new-moon day. The Pitrs had come on the preceding day. The sacrifice (naturally) went to the Pitrs. The gods asked for it back. They (the Pitṛs) did not give it back. They said, &ldquo;We ask for a boon; then we shall give it back to you. An offering should be given to us on the preceding day, Therefore, (a rite) is performed for the Pitrs on the preceding day. In that one makes an offering to Pitrs on the preceding day, having bought away the sacrifice from the Pitrs the sacrificer proceeds.&rdquo; So says the Brāhmaṇa.&rsquo; If (the sacrificer) does not get a cow, he procures a sheep or a goat. Or having cooked rice (won) in dice and having poured over it ample ghee or milk, he does with it what is to be done with a cow. It is said, &ldquo;Ghee or milk is indeed the seed of a cow; rice-grains of a bullock.&rdquo; (They are) indeed the cow because of the similarity of part. Being under a canopy (the sacrificer and his family-members) proceed towards the fire duced either in an oven or produced as the result of heat of potsherds on the grass spread over them. Half of the Aupasana fire or the entire Aupasana fire is retained. (Alternatively) the Aupāsana fire is used as the Brāhmaudanika fire. (Because) offerings are made on it (the Brahmaudanika): The rite up to the pouring down of the substances (into the fire-places) is similar. Having divided in three parts the one third portion of substances (he pours two parts) into the places for Sabhya and Avasathya. Or he may imagine the Sabhya and Avasathya in the Ahavaniya. The rites upto the putting of fire-sticks are similar. (The Adhvaryu) puts (on the fires) five fire-sticks each, of different trees, having first dipped them into ghee. What is the order here? Asvattha (Ficus religiosa), Udumbara (Ficus glomerata), Parņa (Butea frondosa), Śami (Prosopis spicigera) Vikankata (Flacourtia sapida)—this is the order</dt>

<dt>What is to be done at the end of (the Işti offered) to Indra-Agni and Aditya?

He should carry forth another fire (from the Garhapatya) for the offering to be made with the Dasahot formula.

<dt>procedure, not otherwise; because the fire which is carried forth becomes secular. (Formal) fire is that in which offering is made with Daśahoty formula. Its mainte- nance should continue till the end of the rite concerned. As soon as the rite is over, the Fire becomes secular. The Tanu-offerings are prescribed. (The sacrificer) gives away the prescribed Dakṣiņās. If he cannot procure them, he should give as many pieces of cloth or as many meals or pots of cooked rice. Thereby he obtains the desired object. He should give away at least one cow, so says the Paingalāyani Brāhmaṇa.&rdquo; (In any case) one should not remain without setting the fires. It is said, &ldquo;One who has set up sacred fires is one among the gods. In that one carries forth fire for him (the Ähitagni) thereby he obtains a thousand desire-yielding (cows). In that one offers his Agnihotra, a thousand. Thereby more than that is meant.</dt>

<dt>On the day preceding the day on which fires are to be set up, the sacrificer procures a fat cow, a new garment, four pitchers of water, three spikes of Udumbara wood, a ladle of Udumbara, a fork of Udumbara without an offshoot for roasting the omentum, all implements pertaining to the Pitryajña other than those for Sthālīpāka-mattress of erakã and pillow, collyrium and ointment, clarified butter, a bundle of grass, wooden sword and thread. To the southern side there is an enclosure. In this enclosure he shaves the sacrificer turned towards the east, the hair on the head being shaved at the end without reciting any formula. Having closely held three bunches of darbha-grass (near the head), he shaves his head with the formula, &ldquo;I shave, I shave closely impelled by god Savity, sharpened by brahman.&rdquo; (The sacrificer says), &ldquo;May my hair which would grow hereafter be for my welfare.&rdquo; While pouring water upon him with a pitcher, he makes the sacrificer who is shaven and whose nails have been pared, recite the verse, &ldquo;May these waters be auspicious to me; may they wash away my misdeed, Pure, let us proceed with the sacrifice.&rdquo; Bathed, having moved to the east, and having worn a new garment and having adorned himself, he applies ghee to his body. Having purified him with twentyone clusters of darbha-grass divided into three parts (i.e.) with seven each without reciting any formula, having taken a pot full of water and having led him to this (south-west) direction, (the Adhvaryu) makes him, gazing into that pot full of water, recite the formulas &ldquo;transferrings of evil&rdquo;, &ldquo;My temper in the lion, my inner disease in the tiger&rdquo; etc.&rdquo; Having recited this Anuvāka to the end, having poured down the water and having thrown away the pot, they return without gazing back.

<dt>Four persons-father (sacrificer) and sons sit around the dice. Father towards the east, the eldest son to the south, the younger one to the west and the youngest to the north. The father draws up twelve dice; thereby he wins. Twelve the eldest, thereby he wins. Twelve the younger, thereby he wins. The dice that remain are pushed towards the youngest. If there are two sons, the father draws the dice twice. If only one, the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife should be the third. If there are no sons, the sacrificer and his wife each should draw twice. This rule applies in the case of three; the same in the case of two. &ldquo;The Kṛta gama is over&rdquo;, so saying they depart. &ldquo;The cow has been won&rdquo;, so saying they get up.

<dt>O Pitrs, Svadhā namaḥ svāhā.1 Having cut the omentum in three parts, he offers these parts from the ladle of Udumbara respectively with the verses, &ldquo;We make this offering to the mighty Pitṛmant Soma. O strong one, do you enjoy this our (oblation). (O fire) carry the oblation towards gods and Pitrs Svadhā namaḥ svāhā. I invoke Yama accompanied by Angiras and Pitrs. O Vaivasvata, do thou consume this our (oblation). Carry the oblation to gods and Pitrs. Svadhā namaḥ svāhā, O Kavyavahana Agni, promoting order, do thou offer to Pitrs. Do thou carry the oblation towards the gods and Pitrs. Let the oblation go to gods and Pitṛs. Svadhā ṇamaḥ svāhā.” Having put the ladle (on the fire) without reciting any formula, he gives the portions with the procedure for rice-balls-first the heart, then the left kidney then the right one with the formula, &ldquo;This is for thee O father, N.N., and also for those who would follow thee and whom thou hast followed. This is O father, thy ever-lasting oblation; thy portion is as big as the earth; that much portion I offer thee; (O oblation) thou art equal to the earth, for my father; do thou not be destroyed.&rdquo; He gives the second oblation with the formula, &ldquo;This is for thee, O grand-father, N.N., and also for those who would follow thee and whom thou hast followed. This is O grand-father, thy everlasting oblation, thy portion is as big as the mid-region; that much portion I offer thee. (O oblation) thou art equal to mid- region, for my grand-father; do thou not be destroyed.&rdquo; He gives the third portion with the formula, &ldquo;This is for thee, O great grand-father N.N., and also those who would follow thee and whom thou hast followed. This is O great grand-father, thy everlasting oblation; thy portion is as big as the heaven; that much portion I offer thee. (O oblation), thou art equal to heaven for my great grand-father; do thou not be destroyed.&rdquo;</dt>
<dt>Having said, &ldquo;O Pitṛs, do you enjoy your portions respectively,&rdquo; he sprinkles (that place) with (the second) pitcher full of water without reciting any formula. Having approached the (immolated) cow he causes the blood to flow for them (Pitrs) with the mantras, &ldquo;The Rakṣases which are fond of blood and also the Pitrs may they carry, severally carry (the blood). (O Cow) let them be gratified with thy blood-The foetuses which are fallen down, which have blood as their share and which are fallen down, which have blood as their share and which are here, let this belong to them. Svadhà namah. Let them be gratified and let them enjoy. Those of us who are raw, who are ripe, who are wicked and who fall down, Cf Sat GS II.10.7 ApP II. 19; ViṣṇuSm 73.12, 15; ĀpŚS 1.9.9.

<dt>With the help of water from the third pitcher, according to the commentary subodhinī on the BaudhŚS. Mere blood having already been thickened, would not flow at the desired place.

Let them be gratified and let them enjoy.&rdquo; Coming back, he offers them collyrium; he offers them ointment; he gives them pieces of cloth. Then he prays to them with namaskāra formulas* in the reverse order. He asks for heroic sons. Then having raised them and having caused them to depart, he invokes the mind with three verses, &ldquo;We summon the mind hither with the praise of Narāśamsa and the reverence to the Pitrs-Let our mind return to us for vigour, for insight, for life, and that we may long see the sun-May the Pitrs restore mind to us; may the host of the gods; may we belong to the band of the living.&rdquo; At this juncture, having given away the new piece of garment to a brāhmaṇa knowing (the significance of the rite), and having worn another piece of cloth to be discarded (later), and having moved towards the south, he sprinkles himself with water.&rdquo;</dt>

<dt>At this stage, having taken off the piece of cloth (already worn) to be discarded he rises up from the fire with the verse addressed to Prajapati,&rdquo; O Prajapati, none other than thee has encompassed all the creations. With whatever desire we offer unto thee, may we attain that desire. May we be lords of wealth.&rdquo; He inserts back the firebrand with the verse, &ldquo;The Jatavedas Agni has become the carrier of oblation; he has carried the oblations making them fragrant.

He should provide food as he likes. Having dissected the cow, he gives (the flesh) as boon to the brāhmaṇas. Those who receive the flesh of this cow, all of them become the givers of cow.&rdquo;</dt>

<dt>Having offered on the fire procured from a neighbour the Jaya,” Abhyātāna3 and Rāṣtrabhṛt oblations (the Adhvaryu) offers the Amatyal&rdquo; oblations. This (Gopitryajña) is indeed the Upavastha (of the setting up of fires). On this day gods come to stay (with the purpose) that next morning we shall win beautiful wealth. The beautiful wealth of gods is indeed the cake on eight potsherds for Agni. Beautiful wealth goes to him for whom one, knowing this, offers a cow. He crosses all evil. He crosses (the sin of) a murder of a brāhmaṇa. He wins untimely death. So said Prajapati. These (Amatya) oblations are also called as Kūsmāṇḍa, or Kājavas or Amatyahomas or Atimokṣas. Whatever evil act one does in this world, having been released from all that, free from debt, he goes to heaven, so said Prajāpati.</dt>

One should set up fire under the Punarvasu constellation. Under the Pūrvā Phalgunī, Uttara Phalguni (or) Citrā. Now the consideration of seasons. A brāhmaṇa should set up</dt>
<dt>fire in spring; a Rājanya in summer, a Vaišya in autumn; a Rathakāra in rainy season. One should indeed set up the fire when an earnest faith urges him to do so. That conduces to his prosperity. This concession of time is for one who is distressed and is endowed with faith. Now indeed the Brāhmaṇa goes, &ldquo;One who sets fire under Rohiņi prospers; he ascends all heights.&rdquo; The new-moon day which occurs posterior to the full-moon of Vaiśākha coincides with Rohiņi once in a year. One should set up fire on that day.</dt>
<dt>For him (the sacrificer) a hall or an apartment is erected in a sacrificial place already chosen. Two doors are set to it-in the east and in the south. A place for the Garhapatya is prepared in the middle. The place for the Ahavaniya towards the east at a distance of twelve steps or at a distance fixed by eyesight. Towards the south for the Anvāhāryapacana fire at an equal distance (from both the fire-places). Or at such a distance that there would be two parts to the east and one to the west. After the Adhvaryu has dug out at three places and has sprinkled water with the downward palm, the sacrificer gets his hair and beard shaved; gets his nails pared. Similarly, the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife (goes through the rite) except the shaving of hair. Both of them who have worn new pieces of cloth become adorned with human decorations. (The Adhvaryu) causes the food pertaining to the adoption of vow to be cooked for them. The two consume it mixed with melted ghee and milk.</dt>
<dt>II.13</dt>
<dt>At the time when (rays of) the sun have been resting on the tops of trees, (the Adhvaryu) asks for all grains, vessel of clarified butter together with the spoon, ladle, sacrificial grass, piece of cloth, and chips of wood for enkindling.

<dt>approach him. After having cleansed the pan and having spread ghee in it, he scoops out in it this (cooked rice) without bringing (those pots) in contact. Having made a cavity (in the cooked rice) for ghee, and having poured into it ample ghee, he makes an offering of the rice drawn (from the pan) with the verse, &ldquo;May this humble speech be for the creator, the wise, the holy, sprinkling bull. Let that be fearless for us from which there is fear. I remove by sacrifice the angry gods.&rdquo; Or he prays with this verse. Having seated the four priests claiming descent from Rṣis towards the north-each one in a quarter having given them water for sipping successively, he moves for them this (rice) overground without leaving the contact of the earth. Having eaten the rice three times, they praise, &ldquo;Thy Brahmaudana is well-cooked.&rdquo; (The sacrificer) gives them an uncastrated steer. A brāhmaṇa seated towards the north eats the crust of the rice. (The sacrificer) gives him whatever he likes.</dt>

<dt>Having besmeared the fire-sticks with the remnants of the clarified butter, he puts them (on fire) for a brāhmaṇa sacrificer with the Gayatri verses, “Do you worship Agni with a fire-stick; do you illumine him with ghee; do you offer oblations unto him-O Agni, desired by all, may (the fire-sticks) accompanied by oblations and accomplished with ghee approach thee; do thou approve of my fire-sticks. O Angiras, we feed thee with fire-sticks and ghee. O youngest, do thou shine brightly.&ldquo;2 For a Rājanya sacrificer with the Tristubh verses, &ldquo;I illumine with mind, with ghee, Agni residing in all worlds, broad, crosswise, advanced in age, promptly obtaining varied food-I illumine thee with speech, with ghee; do thou enjoy it with open mind. With mortal glory, with agreeable colour with swollen body, Agni is such that one cannot touch him. Giving life, O Agni, be rejoining in oblation, with a face brilliant through ghee, with ghee as the birth-place. Having drunk ghee which is sweet, delightful, product of cow, do thou protect him like the father his son. For a Vaisya sacrificer with the verses, &ldquo;Agni who is guardian of men, wakeful, skilful. With his face brilliant with ghee, brilliant with vast flames touching the heaven, bright, he shines for the Bharatas-O lucky Agni, human beings worship thee-knowing the function of a priest, discerning, giving brilliant wealth, con- cealed, seen by all, of impetuous spirit, easy for offering, brilliant with ghee-O Agni, seven are thy fire-sticks, seven tongues, seven seers, seven dear abodes; seven priests offer thee in seven ways; do thou fill seven birth-places with ghee.&rdquo; In connection with the offering of fire-sticks (the sacrificer) gives away a heifer.</dt>

<dt>While handing over the two kindling woods to him (the sacrificer), (the Adhvaryu) says, &ldquo;You will be restraining speech; instruct what you have to instruct.” He (the sacrificer) says, &ldquo;Give food to brāhmaṇas, keep a guard on the horse, keep ready the substances.&rdquo; His setting the fires brings prosperity. That is the prosperity of the setting up of fires. They say: one should not immolate a cow in the setting up of fires; it is a cruelty. One should immolate; alternatively one should not; or one may immolate many; he will meet with abundent praise, so said Katya.1 Then (the Adhvaryu) hands over the kindling woods to him (the sacrificer). He (the sacri- ficer) receives them with the verses, &ldquo;O you great (kindling woods) guardians of people, seats of the holy order, do you come hither, carriers of wealth. Do you, pregnant ones, generate the fire, the forerunner of sacrifices-Do you (O kindling woods), mount up on my ten fingers. Do thou, O Agni, mount upon me with the holy order, long life and strength so that, living long year after year, I may perform the Full-moon and New-moon sacrifices.&rdquo; He holds them fast with the formula, &ldquo;You are capable of procreation with fire as the semen virile; bear the foetus. I hold you as such. Truly you bear a heroic son; you will generate a heroic son. (Next) morning you will procreate for me; procreating for me you will provide me with offspring, cattle and brahman-splendour in the heaven.&rdquo; Then (the Adhvaryu) leads him to truth from untruth to the divine from the human with the formula, &ldquo;Here do I go to truth from untruth, to the divine from the human, I restrain the divine speech.&rdquo; Him who has restrained speech they keep awake throughout the night. They enkindle the fire with wooden chips that night with the verse, “May I, enkindling the fire with wooden chips, win both the worlds. Having prospered in both the worlds, I shall cross over the death.&rdquo; To the north of the Garhapatya fire- place, he fastens a spotted goat, and makes him gaze at this fire to be set with the verse, &ldquo;O Agni, do thou bring together progeny and quarters with cattle. Place within him subjects which have been in the impulse of Savitṛ.</dt>

<dt>Now the Adhvaryu, having hastened up in the latter part of night, heats the two kindling woods with the verse, &ldquo;O Jātavedas Agni, do thou sprinkle here semen virile of earth which would be created out of heat, the fire, the carrier of oblations, the rejoining, creating from Asvattha grown on the Śami-This is thy natural birth place born of which thou hast shone. Knowing it, do thou, O Agni, go upwards and increase our wealth.&rdquo; Having placed this Agni in a pan, they keep it enflamed towards the south. (The Adhvaryu) causes the fire-places to be smeared with a ball of dung. Having taken up one third of the substances, he puts it into the place for Gārhapatya. With the verse, &ldquo;That imperishable (part) of the earth which became united with thee, Agni has given it to Agni; may this fire be deposited within it.&ldquo;2 At the spot where he finds the saline soil, there, referring to it he murmurs the formula, &ldquo;That black which is in the moon, may it be here.&rdquo; He arranges it with the formula, &ldquo;I put thee yielding all cattle, together with the valour of heaven, expansion of the earth and nourishment of mid-region.&rdquo; He mixes it together with the verses, &ldquo;I unite your hearts; may your mind be united; may your birth be united, may your bodies be dear; may your soul be dear, may my bodies be dear.&rdquo; He renders it harmonious with the verses, &ldquo;May heavan and earth be harmonious; may the waters and plants be harmonious; may the various fires having common vows be harmonious for my superiority.

<dt>Then he prays to this (fire) with the verses, &ldquo;I am thy origin.

May this Agni be dear to us together with the cattle. Do thou cook delicious food for the son and the grandson.&rdquo; I deposit thee, O lord of vows, with the vow of these gods.&rdquo; (He mentions the name of the Rsi) as the Rsi may be; (he mentions the gotra) as the gotra may be. (He further adds) &ldquo;with the Gayatrî metre.&rdquo; He throws a piece of gold towards the north with the formula, “Do thou be born with thy own body.&rdquo; He throws this silver piece towards a low caste or an unknown person. (Thereby) he casts away the distress itself. So says the Brāhmaṇa. Alternatively, he deposits the Anvāhāryapacana from the Garhapatya itself. &ldquo;Prajapati created Agni. He became frightened that he would burn him. He (Prajapati) divided his greatness in three parts, for peace and non-burning.&rdquo; So goes the Brāhmaṇa, He then prays to him with the verse, &ldquo;May these riches come to me. May I live here together with these offspring. May the manifold food remain here. O Jātavedas, do thou shine in the midst of the wealth.TM</dt>
<dt>Having returned by the route by which he had gone, he puts (on the fire) a faggot to be carried forth. He puts it at such time that he would think the Ahavaniya fire would be set up when the sun is half arisen. So it happens. Supporting (sand) is arranged. The horse which is harnessed for the first time and which is washed stands towards the east. Then he says to the Udgātṛ, &ldquo;Do you chant Vamadevya Saman.&rdquo; He lifts up that (fire) with the verses, &ldquo;I lift thee up for vigour and strength, the sprinkler for might, long life and splendour. Thou art the smiter of enemies, the smiter of evils-O Agni, being pleased, do thou come to us with thy greatness among the gods (i.e.) heavan thy soul which has entered the cattle and thy prosperitywhich pervades among men-From the heaven, earth, midregion, wind, cattle and plants wherever O Jātavedas, thou art generated, do thou, O Agni, come</dt>

<dt>The horse is led in front. He follows him with the verse, “O Agni, do thou, knowing, go ahead towards the east. Do thou become Agni going ahead of Agni. Illuminating all directions, do thou shine. Do thou grant strength to our biped and quadruped.&rdquo; They halt in the middle with the verse, &ldquo;Do thou take a stride, thou art great. Taking a seat for men, do thou go on burning in the three worlds. Then they go ahead with the verse, “Jātavedas Agni has appeared following the Usas first of all; he has appeared following the rays of the sun on all sides; he is spread along the heaven and earth.” He makes the horse facing the east tread on the northern side of the substances (spread in the fire-place) so that the embers of the deposited fire-would pass on (the foot-print of the horse). Then having turned him (the horse) by the right and having sprinkled water over him, he releases him towards the north. He (the horse) belongs to the Adhvaryu.

<dt>Turning by the right (the Adhvaryu) deposits the burning faggot (in the fire- place) with the mantras, &ldquo;This which belonging to the heaven (stands on the earth) that which belonging to the earth (stands in the heaven)-the heaven and earth knowing both of them have come together. May the Jātavedas Agni, doing good to the offspring and bringing happiness to (my) body sit on the surface of both of them.8 (O Āhavaniya) I deposit thee the life in the immortal-the food-eater for food, the protector for protection.&rdquo; Then he says to the Udgatṛ, “Do you chant the Bṛhat, Vāravantiya and Syaita Samans.&rdquo; He gives the call with regard to all (other Samans).10 While the Bṛhat Saman is being chanted, he deposits the Ähavaniyafire, with the mantras, “Bhur bhuvaḥ suvaḥ fire is the eye.

He keeps it down upon a bundle of grass to the rear of the Ahavaniya fire. He puts the fire-stick in the middle of the Ähavaniya without reciting any formula.

This Iști comes to the conclusion consequent upon the pouring down of the Praṇītā water and the Viṣņu-steps (by the sacrificer). The sacrificer releases his vow.
At the same time, having strewn the Pṛṣṭhya line and having carried forth Praṇītā water, the Adhvaryu pours out paddy for a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra-Agni and rice for Aditi. This rice is cooked in ghee, or when the rice is almost cooked, he pours ghee into it. Having baked and cooked (the oblations), he places (them within the altar). For this (Iști) there are fifteen Samidhenī verses, five Prayāja - offerings and Vārtraghna Ājyabhāgas. The puronuvākya-yājyās of the principal offerings are: indrāgnī rocanā divaḥ3&hellip; and śnathad vṛtram &hellip; for (the cake to) Indra-Agni and aditir na uruşyatu&hellip;a and mahim u şu mātaram&hellip;4 for (the cooked rice to) Aditi. The puronuvākyā - yājyā for the Svistakṛt offering should be in the Triṣṭubh metre. The sacrificer places the Anvāhārya cooked rice (within the altar) and distributes the cooked rice (for Aditi). The four priests consume (that rice). (Thereby the sacrificer) makes offering in the lustre of the directions. So says the Brāhmaṇa. This Iști comes to an end with the pouring down of Praṇītā-water and the Visņu-strides (by the sacrificer). (The sacrificer) releases his vow.
II.20
At this stage (the sacrificer) observes the twelve day&rsquo;s vow. This is his vow: He does not speak untruth, does not eat flesh; does not approach his wife (for sexual intercourse); his garment is not washed with (water impregnated with) alkaline salt; he does not drink water with an earthen pot; he does not allow a Śūdra to eat food left by him; he washes his feet himself; he does not eat salt, does not eat leguminous grains except sesamum; going towards the east and himself fetching fire-sticks, he lies down in the vicinity of fires; his fires are preserved for twelve days; a brāhmaṇa does not stay at his house without having taken food; he, if possible, lives on the remnants of Agnihotra (milk). Boiled rice is brought to the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife.
After twleve days are over, (the Adhvaryu) having strewn the Prsthyā line and having carried forth Pranita-water, pours out (paddy for) a cake on eight potsherds to Pavamana Agni. Having baked the cake, he places it (within the altar). For this (Iști) there are fifteen Sāmidheni verses, five Prayāja-offerings and Vārtraghna Ajyabhāgas. The puronuvākyā and yājyā for the principal offering are agna āyüṁṣi pavase&hellip; and agne pavasva&hellip; The puronuvākyā-yājyā for the Svistakṛt-offering are in Tristubh metre. Having placed the Anvāhārya rice (within the altar), (the sacri- ficer) gives away (as Dakṣiņā) thirty Manas of gold.

After the Agnihotra has been offered in the morning, prior to the carrying forth of Praṇītā water, having melted clarified butter over the Garhapatya, having purified it, having taken up four spoonfuls in the ladle, having gone mentally over the Caturhotṛ formula, (the Adhvaryu) makes an offering with svāhā on the Ähavaniya while the sacrificer has touched him. Having taken up another four spoonfuls, he makes two offerings to Sarasvat. He recites the verse, &ldquo;Full to the rear and full in front, in the middle of the full-moon, she has been victorious. Let the gods dwelling together rejoice here in her in the highest firmament.&rdquo; He makes the offering with the verse, “O Agni and Soma, the first in strength, do you quicken the Vasus, Rudras, Adityas here. Rejoice in him with full-moon in the midst, you grown with holy power, won by good deeds and allot to us wealth together with heroes.&rdquo; Having taken up another four spoonfuls, he recites the verse, &ldquo;Holder and gatherer of riches, clad in all rich forms, granting a thousandfold prosperity, the fortunate one has come to us providing with radiance.&rdquo; He makes the offering with the verse, &ldquo;The share in greatness which the gods dwelling together have bestowed on thee, O new-moon, therewith do thou fill our sacrifice, O thou of every boon.

CHAPTER- III
RESETTING OF THE FIRES
III.1
(Now about one who) is going to reset his fires. They say, &ldquo;(the Adhvaryu) had (already) recited the yajus (pertaining to the setting) and had procured the substances. (Therefore, at the resetting) the substances need not be procured, nor is the yajus to be recited. (This is not correct). The substances are indeed to be procured and the yajus (also) is to be recited for the accomplishment of the resetting.&rdquo; He (the sacrificer) procures a refurnished chariot, resewn garment, a bull who is let loose again, aweb of darbha-grass and three handfuls of darbha-grass. The substances pertaining to the setting of fires are well-known. The new-moon day which precedes the full-moon of the month of Aṣādha coalesces with the Punarvasu constellation only once in a year; one should reset on that day.
On the Upavasatha of that day, having consigned the fires into the kindling woods, having gone away, having churned the fire and having spread out fires (the Adhvaryu) who is going to dispose of the (old) fire pours out paddy for (a cake on) eight potsherds for Agni and another on twelve potsherds for Vaiśvānara Agni. That İşti comes to a conclusion with the established procedure. Subsequently, having effused the fires with water and having cooked Brahmaudana (the sacrificer) observes the Upavasatha vow. Next morning the rite pertaining to the setting of fires starts. This much is different: There it is a web of muñja grass here it is a web of darbha-grass. There it is a faggot to be carried forth; here are bundles of darbha- grass. One sets up the Garhapatya with darbha-blades; the Anvāhāryapacana with darbha-blades; the Ahavaniya with darbha-blades. When he sets up the Garhapatya, he adds the Sarparājñī verses2 in recitation.

Carry (our oblations) day by day&ndash;The brilliance of this (fire) moves within (heaven and earth) expirating and inspirating. The great (sun) has illumined the heaven. Three with regard to the Ahavaniya: &ldquo;O Fire, if I excited, disposed of thee through rage or misfortune; may that (disposal) of thine be recompensated. We reillumine thee. That lustre of thine, disposed by me through rage which is dispersed on the earth, may Adityas, Viśve Devas and Vasus recompensate-May the adorable light rejoice in clarified butter; may it unite this scattered sacrifice. May Bṛhaspati accomplish it for us. May Viśve Devas rejoice here.&rdquo; The procedure upto (the rotating of) the chariot-wheel is similar. This much is different: What is there the Agnihotra-offering without reciting any mantra, here he offers with the verse, “O Agni, seven thy tongues, seven Ṛsis, seven dear abodes, seven priesthoods, sacrifice There is a cake on to thee sevenfold; do thou fill seven birth-places with ghee.

Now the consideration of the two Ajyabhāgas. The Ajyabhāgas should be Vārtraghna. This is the view of some teachers. The Ajyabhāgas should be Vṛdhanvant. This is the view of some teachers. (The puronuvākyās of the Ājyabhāgas should be agnim stomena bodhaya and tvam naḥ soma.. respectively. This is the view of some teachers. They should be agna āyüṁși pavase and agne pavasva svapā.&rdquo; This is the view of some teachers. (This is because) what is said to be &ldquo;passing through&rdquo; has the form of Soma. The puronuvākyā-yājyā of the principal offering are in Pankti metre, namely, agne tam adya .. and adhã hy agne. The Adhvaryu offers two oblations (of clarified butter) on both sides of the offering of the cake (that is, before and after) respectively with the verses, &ldquo;Return with strength, return, O Agni, with food and life.

AGNIHOTRA-OFFERING III.4
(The Adhvaryu) having added fuel to the Gāṛhapatya before sunset and having brought the Anvāhāryapacana, draws out flaming Ähavaniya for the evening (Agnihotra) offering. Having added fuel to the Garhapatya before sunrise, and having fetched the Anvāhāryapacana, he draws out flaming Ahavaniya for the morning (Agnihotra) offering. (He draws with the formula), &ldquo;I draw thee out with speech as the Hotṛ, Prāna as the Udgātṛ, the eye as the Adhvaryu, the mind as the Brahman, the ear as the Agnidhra-with these five divine priests (the sacrificer prays with the formula), &ldquo;Bhur bhuvaḥ suvaḥ (O Agni) being drawn out, do thou draw me out of the sin which I might have perpetrated knowingly or unknowingly. Whatever sin I have committed by day, do thou, drawn out, relieve me of all that&rdquo; (thus in the evening).&rdquo;&hellip; whatever sin I have committed by night, do thou, drawout, relieve me of all that&rdquo; (thus in the morning). (The Adhvaryu) deposits the fire with the verse, &ldquo;I offer the oblation of ambrosia into the ambrosia, the fire into the earth for the winning of immortality. May I win the unending desire through it which Prajapati won first. I offer Agni into Agni, ambrosia into Vaiśvānara, svāhā.” Thus in the evening. &ldquo;&hellip; I offer Sürya into Agni, ambrosia into Vaišvānara, svāhā” in the morning.

On the (next) morning, after the Agnihotra has been offered, (the Adhvaryu) having strewn the Pṛsthyā line and having carried forth the Praṇītā water pours out Śyāmāka grains for cooked grains to Soma. Having released speech with the call to the oblation-preparer, having melted clarified butter over the Gārhapatya, having purified it, and having taken up four spoonfuls into the ladle, he offers ajjānī oblations on the Ahavaniya with five verses, &ldquo;(Obeisance) to the hundred weaponed, having a hundred powers, having a hundred aids, the overcomer of hostility, Indra, who is capable of leading us for a hundred years without any harm beyond all evils-O gods, do you all entrust us to that divinity (=Indra) who would lead us without any harm and loss along the four Devayāna paths which stretch differently between the heaven and the earth-May the summer, winter, and spring, autumn and the raining season be favourable to us.

Going away from the fires, he releases his speech. Sleeping on ground, not eating flesh, not approaching his wife, he goes on journey. He does not stay away beyond the twelfth day (of fortnight). he does not allow to pass the Upavastha-day while in journey. While returning he collects fire-sticks on the way. Gazing at his fires from far away, he restrains speech. He prays to the Ahavaniya with the verse, “My name and thine, O Jātavedas, which we bear like man changing garments, let us exchange again-thou for food and we to live.&rdquo;
He prays to the Gārhapatya with the verse, “Obeisance to Agni the unpierced, obeisance to unapproachable, obeisance to the ruler. Agni is irresistible, very powerful, all conquering, assailing, the best Gandharva.&rdquo; He prays to the Anvāhāryapacana with the verse, &ldquo;O Agni, gods have thee for the father, they offer oblations to thee and have thee as an umpire. Do thou endow me with life, with lordship of cattle, and bestow on me good fortune.&rdquo; He prays to the Ahavaniya.</li>

He pours out (paddy) for a cake on eight potshards for Tantument Agni. (The sacrificer) gives away a panful (of grains as Dakṣiņā). The Isți comes to a conclusion in the established manner. Then he offers the transgressed Agnihotra-oblations. The ancient ritualists, desirous of maintaining holy order, desiring lustre, glory and brahman-splendour used to pray in this way. This has (now) gone out of practice on account of the heaviness of the vow. Therefore, (one should observe) the Vairāja prayers. (He prays) to the Gārhapatya with the formula, “O manly (Agni) do thou guard my offspring&hellip;&rdquo;, to the Anvāhāryapacana with the formula, “O Atharva, do thouguard my nourishment&hellip;&rdquo;, to the Ahavaniya with the formula, “Opraiserworthy Agni, do thou guard my cattle&hellip;.&rdquo;, to the Sabhya with the formula, &ldquo;O spreading wide, do thou guard my meeting place&hellip;.&rdquo;, to the Avasathiya with the formula, &ldquo;O Ahi Budhniya, do thou guard my prayer.&rdquo; He goes away for an indefinite period.

(With the verse) &ldquo;By the Yajus I pour on thee offspring, life and wealth. Instigated by Bṛhaspati may the sacrificer here come to no harm.&rdquo; He follows the spilt out portion with &ldquo;Svāhā to Bhupati, Svāhā to Bhuvanapati, Svāhā to lord of Bhūtas.&rdquo; He proceeds with whatever (clarified butter) might have been left. He causes the sacrificer to gaze at the clarified butter with the formula, &ldquo;Thou art butter; thou art truth, thou art the overseer of the truth; thou art the oblation of Vaiśvānara Agni, of Viśve Devas, with pure strength, of true might. Thou art power, overpowering. Overpower hostility; overpower those who practicse hostility, over- power enmity, overpower those who practise enmity. Thou art of thousandfold strength; do thou quicken me. Thou art the butter of butter; thou art the truth of truth, thou hast true life; thou hast true strength; with truth I besprinkle thee. May I share thee that art such. (The sacrificer) follows each portion of clarified butter as it is taken up-that in the Juhû with the four formulas, “I take thee for the control and holding of the five winds, I take thee for the control and holding of the five seasons, I take thee for the control and holding of the five directions, I take thee for the control and holding of the five people.&rdquo; In the Upabhṛt with the eight formulas, &ldquo;I take thee for the control and holding of the sky having five cavities; I take thee for the control and holding of the splendour of a brāhmaṇa, I take thee for the control and holding of the valour of Ksatriya, I take thee for the control and I take holding of the subjects, I take thee for braveness, I take thee for good progeny, thee for prosperity; I take thee for the Brahman splendour.&rdquo; In the Dhruva-ladle with the four formulas, &ldquo;The earth (is) ours; the oblation (is) of gods; the benediction (is) of the sacrificer. I take thee for the divinities of gods.&rdquo; He follows (the Dhruvā) being filled (with clarified butter) with the formula. &ldquo;I take thee for (the fulfilment of my) desire.&rdquo;
He follows the enclosing sticks being laid around-the middle one with the formula, &ldquo;Thou art firm; may I become firm among the kinsmen, intelligent, wise and winning wealth.&rdquo; The southern one with the formula, &ldquo;Thou art mighty; may I become mighty among the kinsmen, intelligent, wise and winning wealth. The northern one with the formula, &ldquo;Thou art overcoming, may I be overcoming among the kinsmen; intelligent, wise and winning wealth,&rdquo; He joins them with the Yoga formula, &ldquo;I yoke thee with the divine Brahman to bear this oblation, O wise one. While the two fire-sticks are being kept erect, he murmurs the verse, &ldquo;Kindling thee, may we live long with good offspring, good heroes and preventing thee tribute. He recites over the oblations being deposited within the altar the verse, &ldquo;Whatever O Agni, in this sacrifice of mine may be spoiled, whatever of the clarified butter, O Visnu, may be spilt, therewith do I smite the rival who is hard to slay. I place him on the lap of Nirṛti.&rsquo;

&ldquo;One should keep down the Agnihotra (ladle filled with milk) with the Vyahṛtis, bhur, bhuvaḥ suvaḥ. Agnihotra indeed is the mouth of sacrifice; these Vyāhṛtis indeed are the Brahman; he (thereby) places the Brahman in the mouth of sacrifice. He should keep it down with these (Vyāhṛtis) at the close of a year. (Thereby) he enfolds the year on both sides with Brahman.&rdquo; So says the Brāhmaṇa. Thus indeed (the Brāhmaṇa) goes, &ldquo;One who is performing the Full-moon or New- moon sacrifice should deposit the oblations with these Vyahṛtis. The Full-moon and New-moon sacrifices are indeed the mouth of sacrifice; these Vyahrtis are the Brahman. He places the Brahman into the mouth of sacrifice. He should deposit (the oblations) with these (Vyāhṛtis) at the close of a year. He enfolds the year on both sides with Brahman.&rdquo; So says the Brāhmaṇa. Thus, indeed (the Brahmana) goes, &ldquo;One who is performing the Caturmasyas should deposit the oblations with these Vyahṛtis; the Caturmasyas indeed are the mouth of sacrifice; these Vyāhṛtis are the Brahman. He places the Brahman in the mouth of sacrifice. He should deposit (the oblations) with these (Vyāhṛtis) at the close of a year. He enfolds the year on both sides with Brahman.&rdquo; So says the Brahmana. Thus, indeed (the Brāhmaṇa) goes, &ldquo;Whatever of the sacrifice is done with the Saman, the blessing of the sacrifice goes to the ruling class; whatever with Rk, the blessing of the sacrifice goes to the Vis. (Consequently) a Brāhmaṇa performs a blessingless sacrifice.
&ldquo;(The Hot who) is going to recite the Samidheni verses should first utter these Vyahṛtis. (Thus), he makes a beginning with Brāhmaṇa. Therebya Brāhmaṇa performs a blessingful sacrifice.&rdquo; So says the Brāhmaṇa. &ldquo;(The Brāhmaṇa) indeed goes: &ldquo;In the sacrifice of sacrificer about whom (the Hotr) desires that the blessing of his sacrifice may go to his enemy, he should join the Vyahṛtis to the puronuvākyā. The puronuvākyā has the enemy for its deity. The blessing of his sacrifice goes to the enemy&rdquo; So says the Brahmana. In the sacrifices of those sacrificers about whom (the Hotṛ) desires that the blessings of the sacrifice should equally go to them, he should insert the first of the Vyāhṛtis after the half verse of the puronuvākyā, the second at the beginning of the yājyā, and the third after the half verse of the yājyā. Thereby the blessing of the sacrifice equally goes to them. So says the Brahmana, (The Brāhmaṇa) indeed goes, “Just as a cloud rains abundantly, so a sacrifice pours for the sacrificer. Water is enfolded by ground. The sacrificer enfolds the sacrifice by the blessing.&rdquo; So says the Brahmaṇa. (The Hot) commences (the sacrifice) of a brāhmaṇa with Vyāhṛtis, of a Rājanya with Himkāra; of a Vaišya with the Rk. All these three should be adopted; this is another view. (The sacrificer) follows the faggot being put (on the Ahavaniya).

Having placed it within the altar he makes the sacrificer recite the formula, &ldquo;Thou art real; be real for me; thou art all; be all for me; thou art full; be full for me; thou art imperishable; do thou not perish for me. He scatters (the water) towards the directions with the formulas, &ldquo;In the eastern quarter may the gods and the priests purify (me); in the southern the quarter may the months and Pitrs purify (me); in the western quarter may residence and cattle purify (me); in the northern quarter may the waters, plants and trees purify (me); in the upper quarter may the sacrifice, year and the lord of sacrifice purify (me).

He (the Hotṛ) suspending the cord over the left shoulder, having sipped water, touches his hands together with the formula, “May I be able with your help to perform rites for gods, for capability and for good deed.&rdquo; With two verses he receives Agni within, &ldquo;I receive Agni within me for the abundance of wealth, good offspring and good valour. I hold offspring and strength within me. May we be uninjured in our persons and rich in brave sons&ndash;O Pitrs, Agni the immortal who has entered the hearts of us the mortals, we receive him within us, may he not go away leaving us.&rdquo; He enters (the sacrifical hall) inbetween the altar and the rubbishheap with the formula, &ldquo;I resort to truth, I resort to the cosmic order, I resort to the immortal, I resort to Prajapati&rsquo;s dear and harmless body. I trample down with the fifteenfold thunderbolt the enemy who hates us and whom we hate. Bhür Bhuvaḥ Suvaḥ, I stand in Visnu&rsquo;s place.&rdquo; He stands tresspassing the northern border of the altar with the right forefoot.
When he knows (about the Adhvaryu&rsquo;s call), &ldquo;Do you recite verses for the fire being enkindled,&rdquo; he murmurs the formula, &ldquo;Whom do I resort to? I resort to him. I resort to the metre which O Prajapati, is thy resort. I shall do that much which O Vişņu, I am aware of. Impelled by god Savity, I shall execute the priesthood.

THE ANIMAL-SACRIFICE
IV.1
(The sacrificer) proposes to perform an animal-sacrifice.

Now after having performed the New-moon sacrifice or one on an (auspicious) constellation, after having melted clarified butter over the Garhapatya fire, having purified it, having taken up four spoonfuls in the ladle and having mentally gone over the Saddhotr formula, (the Adhvaryu) makes an offering on the Ahavaniya fire with svāhā while the sacrificer has contacted him. Having taken up another four spoonfuls, he offers an oblation pertaining to the sacrificial post with the verse, &ldquo;O Viṣņu, do thou bestride wide. Make a wide (provision) for our residence. Do thou, who hast ghee as thy birth-place, drink ghee and increase the lord of sacrifice.&rdquo; Having taken up another four spoonfuls (in the ladle), he asks for a vessel of clarified butter together with a spoon, sacrificial grass, (a piece of) gold and a pot filled with water.

Having gone out by the eastern door they move towards that direction where (a tree suitable for) the sacrificial post is visible or where he thinks he may come across one. He prays to that tree which is grown on level ground independently, which has many leaves, many branches, with undried tip and bent towards the west with the formula, &ldquo;I have passed over other (trees), I have not approached other (trees). I have come across thee nearer than the distant ones, distant than the He inferior ones. I welcome thee that belongest to Visnu for the sacrifice to gods. besmears it with clarified butter with the formula, “May god Savity besmear thee with honey.&rdquo; With the formula, &ldquo;O plant, do thou guard him,&rdquo; he holds erect a darbha-blade with its tip upwards alongside the tree. He strikes it across with the axe with the formula, &ldquo;O axe, do thou not injure him.&rdquo; He preserves knowingly the first chip which falls down. (The wood-cutter) cuts (the tree) without allowing it to crack around and in such a way that its stump would not clash with the axle (of a cart),

It is reasonable to understand the word prādeśamātrim as denoting the height of the Uttaravedi, Bhavasvamin and the author of the commentary subodhini on the BaudhŚS relate this word to the Uttaranābhi. The subodhini, however, cites a view according to which the word denotes the height. I find this view as reasonable, and have given the translation accordingly.

Having touched them together with the formula, &ldquo;They have sat down&hellip;.&rdquo; turning by the right and hastening towards the west, he asks for Prokṣani-water mixed with barley, a handful of sacrificial grass, vessel of clarified butter together with the spoon, the cord and the Svaru, Maitrāvaruņa&rsquo;s staff, a chip of the sacrificial post, a piece of gold and a pot filled with water. Keeping all this together he washes the sacrificial post with the verse, &ldquo;What of thee the clever wood-cutter has cut by means of the axe taken in hand, may the cleansing waters, O wood, remove it.&rdquo; The sacrificial post, washed, brought in, furnished with the caṣāla lies to the east of the hole. Standing to the north of the Ahavaniya, he sprinkles it from east to west with the formula, “For earth thee, for mid-region thee, for heaven thee.&rdquo; He pours water into the hole with the formula, “May the region for seating the Pitrs be purified.&rdquo; He throws barley-grains (into the hole) with the formula, &ldquo;Thou art barley-grain, do thou drive away the enemy from us, do thou drive away the evil spirits.&rdquo; Expanding the handful of sacrificial grass, he scatters it over the hole with the formula, &ldquo;Thou art the seat of the Pitrs.&rdquo; He offers spoonful of clarified butter across a piece of gold with the formula, “Svāhā to Pitṛs.&rdquo; He puts the chip of the post (into the hole) with the formula, &ldquo;Thou art easily accessible, the foregoer of the leaders; the post will stand upon thee; do thou know of it.&rdquo;

5. TS.VI.3.6; says dharṣā mānuṣān iti niyunakti dhṛtyai, Baudhayana always lays down the injunction first and then the relevant mantra. Therefore W. Caland, the editor of the Sūtra-text is right when he reads the sutra-samdadhāti dharṣā mānuṣān iti, and further deems niyunakti as a single-worded sutra. As a matter of fact, joining of two cords-one of the post and the other of the animal itself means the fastening of the animal. The next single-worded sūtra must be regarded mainly as an explanatory repetition, BhārŠS, ApsS etc, have connected dharṣā mānuṣān with niyunakti.

“O Soma, may we enjoy bearing the mind in our bodies under thy ordinance and possessed of progeny.&rdquo; (The Adhvaryu) gives out the call, &ldquo;O Agnidh, do thou bring embers for the Upayaj offerings; O offerer of the Upayajs, do thou seat thyself; O Brahman, we shall proceed, having put the fire-stick; do thou, O Agnïdh, cleanse the fires once each.&rdquo; Embers for Upayajs are brought from the Samitra fire; (the Adhvaryu) pours them down in front of the Hotṛ. The offerer of the Upayajs sits down taking one third part of the rectum with anus. The Adhvaryu having dipped the spoon into the Pṛṣadājya, having taken it into the Juhu, having crossed (the altar) and having caused to announce, says to the Maitrāvaruņa, “Do you direct (the Hotṛ to recite the yājyä) for the gods.&rdquo; He makes the offering at the Vasat-utterance. (Subsequently he says) &ldquo;Do you direct&rdquo;, &ldquo;Do you direct.&rdquo; Similarly the offerer of the Upayajs makes offering of each piece of rectum with anus with the eleven formulas beginning with &ldquo;Do thou go to the occan svāhā.&rdquo; With the formula, &ldquo;Do thou go to Vaiśvānara Agni, svähä” he finally puts into the fire the remaining portion. He cleanses his hands on the Barhis with the formula, &ldquo;To the waters thee, to the plants thee; do thou grant me mind and heart.&rdquo; He gazes at its smoke with the formula, &ldquo;May I acquire body, skin, son and grandson.&rdquo; Having crossed towards the north and having put the Svaru into the Juhū, he offers it standing to the east and facing the west, with the formula, &ldquo;Let thy smoke go to the heaven, the flame to the midregion; do thou fill in the earth with ashes, svähā.&rdquo; Having kept the two ladles in their places, he separates them with the two Vajavati verses. Having dismantled the Prastara and enclosing sticks with the Samyuvāka formula1 (recited by the Hotr), having caused the two ladles to flow (the drops on the fire) and having released them, he offers the Patnisamyājas by means of the tail.

(One who) is going to offer the Vaiśvadeva-oblations (should do so) on the full- moon day of Phalguna or Caitra. Some say that one should do so under the specific constellation. One should offer them in the northern course of the sun in the bright half of the month on an auspicious day. He procures a three-striped quill of a porcupine, an iron-razor, four sets of potsherds for cakes, four cooking vessels, as many corn-stirring sticks, two (pots of) milk, curds for Prṣadājva and for curdling, sacrificial grass tied up in three bundles which are again fastened in one bundle and a Prastara of darbha-grass with tuft.
On the Upavasatha-day (the Adhvaryu) performs the Årambhaniyā Işti com- prising two oblations-a cake on twelve potsherds to Vaisvänara Agni and cooked rice to Parjanya. The Iști comes to a conclusion in the prescribed manner. This day the calves are separated from their mothers for the oblation to Viśve Devas. Having caused the milk to be milked for the oblation to Viśve Devas (the sacrificer) observes the vow following the procedure applied in the case of Samnayyal or without reciting any formula.
After he has offered the Agnihotra, the Adhwaryu, prior to the carrying forth of Pranita-waters, having melted ghee over the Garhaparya and having purified it, having taken four spoonfuls in the ladle, having mentally gone along the Pafcahotr formula, makes an offering on the Ahavaniya with Svähä-utterance while the sacrificer has contacted him. Having strewn the Prsthya line and having carried forth water, he pours (paddy for a cake on) eight potsherds to Agni, rice to Soma, a cake on twelve potsherds to Savity, rice to Sarasvant, rice to Püşan, a cake on seven potsherds to Maruts, Amikṣă (coagulated milk) to Viśve Devas and a cake on one potsherd to Dyäväpṛthivi. (The sacrificer) releases speech at the call to the preparer of oblation-material. The ritual up to the pouring of rice-grains on the lower crushing stone is similar. Having poured (the rice-grains), be lays down eight potsherds in the southern half of the Garhapatya fire-place. In the northern side he puts over fire a vessel for cooked rice to Soma after having poured into it water across the strainers. Towards the north he lays down twelve potsherds for the cake to Savity. Towards the north he puts over fire vessels for rice to Sarasvant and Püsan after having poured into them water across the strainers. To the north he lays down</p>

To the north he lays down a potsherd for the cake to Dyaväpṛthivi. Fuel is put around the potsherds and under the cooking vessels. Having poured the flour which has been obtained by crushing into the pan, and having mixed it with water, he puts on eight potsherds (the dough) for Agni. He pours (rice-grains) for cooked rice to Soma across the strainers. He places on twelve potsherds (the dough) for the cake to Savity. He pours (into the vessels) rice-grains for cooked rice to Sarasvant and Pūşan. He places (dough) for the cake on seven potsherds to Maruts. He pours curds across the strainers into the hot milk. Some expert, having cooked it by adding fuel around and having rendered it free from whey, keeps it in a cool place. Then he keeps (the dough of) the cake on one potsherd for Dyäväpṛthivi. After having made the cakes catch the crust, having baked, having taken down, having gone to the east, having poured down (the wash-water for the Apyas, he carries the Stambayajus.

(The rite) is prescribed in the Pauroḍāsika Brahmana. (The Adhvarvu carried the stambayajus) three times with the formula and the fourth time without reciting any formula. He does the first tracing (of the altar). He murmurs the Karana formula.2 He digs out (the altar). From the dug out part the Agnidhra carries (the earth) three times. When the Agnidhra carries earth three times, the Adhvaryu, having done the second tracing out, having made the ground firm, having stuck the wooden sword crosswise, gives out the call, “Do thou (O Ágnïdhra) put down the Prokṣaṇi-water, keep ready the faggot and sacrificial grass, cleanse the spoon and the ladles (with the relevant formulas) and the Prsadajya-ladle silently. wind the girdle round (the waist of) the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife, and come up with the clarified butter and curds.&rdquo; After he has brought the Proksani-water, having cleansed and thrown the wooden sword, having kept near the faggot and the sacrificial grass, turning by the right and hastening towards the west, the Âgnidhra cleanses the spoon and ladles (with formulas) and the Prsadajya-ladle silently. After the Agnidhra has wound the girdle round the waist of the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife and after he has come up with clarified butter and curds, the Adhvaryu, having purified the clarified butter and the Prokṣani-water, having taken up clarified butter into the ladles in the prescribed manner together with the Prṣadajya, stands up with Prokṣaṇi-water in hand.</li>

After four months he proposes to sacrifice with Varuṇapraghasa oblations. He procures a three-stripped quill of a porcupine, a razor of black iron, four sets of potsherds, five vessels for cooking rice, as many corn-stirring sticks, milk in two (pots), curds for Pṛṣadājya and for coagulating, leaves of Sami-tree (Prosopis spicigera), flour of parched Karira fruits, a winnowing basket of Işika grass, Karambha- pots as many as male persons plus one made of barley-grains which are a little frosted and powdered after being besmeared with ghee. A male sheep and a female sheep are also made out of those (grains). The male sheep is with horns; the fernale sheep is hornless. They are covered with white wool. Two Adhvaryus, two sets of sacrificial implements, two sets of faggot and sacrificial grass, two altars&ndash;the northern one like that in an animal-sacrifice; the southern one like that in Full- moon and New-moon sacrifices. They are in a line towards the west, in different lines towards the east. The altars are distant from each other by thirteen angulas. On this day two sets of calves are separated from their mothers-for the Maruts and for Varuna. Having got milk milked at two places (the sacrificer) observes fast in the manner of Sämnäyya or silently.
In the morning when he has offered the Agnihotra, the Adhvaryu, having strewn the Prṣthyā line, having carried forth (Praṇītā) waters, pours (paddy) for five passing (samcara) oblations beginning with a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, (then) a cake on eleven potsherds to Indra-Agni, coagulated milk to Maruts, coagulated milk to Varuna and a cake on one potsherd to Ka. (The sacrificer) releases speech at the call to the preparer of oblation-material. The rite up to the carrying round of the fire is similar. Here fire is carried round the Karamblia pots, female sheep, male sheep, leaves of Sami tree and flour of parched Karira fruits and the winnowing basket of Işika grass. Having made the cakes catch the crust, having cooked (the oblations), having taken them down, having gone to the east, having poured down (wash-water) for the Apyas, (the Adhvaryu and the Praprasthat) carry the Stambayajus. The Adhvaryu carries the Stambayajus from the northern altar, the Pratiprasthätṛ from the southern one. Of the two carrying Stambayajus, the Adhvaryu goes first, of the returning two, the Pratiprasthat goes first. (The rite) is prescribed in the Pauroḍāšika Brahmana.2 (They carry the Stambayajus) three times with the formula, and the fourth time silently. They do the first tracing of the altar. After the altars have been dug out, the Adhvaryu alone murmurs the Karana formula. From the dug out altars the Agnidhra carries (the earth) three times.</p>

The Adhvaryu himself gives out the call, &ldquo;O Agnidh, do thou cleanse the fires each thrice.&rdquo; While the northern fire is cleansed and the southern one is not, the Pratiprasthätṛ asks the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife, &ldquo;O sacrificer&rsquo;s wife, who is thy paramour?&rdquo; &ldquo;N.N.&rdquo; (she replies). &ldquo;May Varuņa catch him&rdquo;, says he. If she does not mention even though one exists, she would bring calamity to her beloved kinsmen. She should therefore refer, &ldquo;N.N. is my paramour.&rdquo; Mentioning his name, she causes him to be fastened with Varuņas&rsquo; bond, so says the Brāhmaṇa. Having collected in a winnowing basket of Iṣika grass the Karambha-pots round which fire has been moved, he hands it over to the wife. She holds them on her head.
Then having led her out by the southern door, while leading her towards the east, having gone around along the south of the Anvähäryapacana fire and along the south of both the altars, makes her utter the verse, &ldquo;We invoke the voracious Maruts, the receivers of sacrifice and agreeable with the Karambha.&rdquo; They stand in front of the southern fire facing towards the west-the Adhvaryu to the north, the sacrificer to his south and the wife to his south. The wife hands over the Karambha-pots to the sacrificer. He holds them over his head. He recites the puronuvakya.

After four months (the sacrificer) proposes to offer Sākamedha-offerings. He procures a three-striped quill of a porcupine, a razer of black iron, four sets of potsherds, four vessels for cooking rice, as many corn-stirring sticks and curds for Prṣadajya. On the Upavasatha day of the full-moon the (Adhvaryu) pours (paddy) for a cake on eight potsherds to Anikavant Agni at sunrise. The Işti comes to an end in the prescribed manner. At midday he pours (paddy for) cooked rice for Samtapana Maruts. The Işti comes to an end in the prescribed manner. On this day calves (of the cows) are driven away for an oblation to Gṛhamedhin Maruts. In the evening after he has offered the Agnihotra, (the Adhvaryu) having cooked rice for Gṛhamedhin Maruts in the milk of all cows on the Gärhapatya fire and having poured ghee over it, takes it down towards the north. Having cleansed the vessel and having spread clarified butter in it, he draws into it the rice as if without striking at it. Having made a cavity for ghee into it, and having poured ample ghee, he places it within the altar. He offers the Ajyabhāgas to Agni and Soma. Having spread clarified butter (into the ladle), while taking portion of cooked rice from the eastern half, he says (to the Hotr) &ldquo;Do you recite the puronuväkyä for Gṛhamedhin Maruts.&rdquo; Having taken portion from the eastern half, he takes portion from the rear half. He pours clarified butter over it and anoints back (the oblation). Having crossed and having caused to announce, he says (to the Hot), &ldquo;Do you recite the yajyä for Gṛhamedhin Maruts.&rdquo; He offers at the Vasat-utterance. Then he offers the Svistakṛt offering. The Gṛhamedhiya sacrifice comes to an end with the Ida. He keeps back the scrapings of cooked rice for the Pürnadarvya offering. Auxiliary rice is cooked for womenfolk and children. They consume it. All put collyrium into their eyes and anoint themselves. The calves are allowed to join (their mothers).

offering with the verse, &ldquo;Do thou give me, I shall give thee. Do thou bestow upon me, I shall bestow upon thee. Do thou accept my offering; I shall accept thy grant, svähā. Saying &ldquo;O bull, come,&rdquo; he makes the offering at the bellowing of the bull. (He does so) at the him- utterance by the Brahman. This is another view. He makes an offering with Svähä-utterance on the Garhapatya while the sacrificer has contacted him. Having strewn the Pṛṣṭhya line and having carried the (Pranita- waters), he pours out (paddy for a cake) on seven potsherds to Kridin Maruts at sunrise. The Işti comes to an end in the prescribed manner.

Immediately afterwards, having strewn the Prsthyä line and having carried forth (Praṇītā) waters, he pours out (paddy) for passing (samcara) oblations beginning with a cake on eight potsherds to Agni, a cake on eleven potsherds to Indra-Agni, cooked rice to Indra and a cake on one potsherd to Viśve Devas. Having made the cakes catch the crust, having kept them on fire, having covered them with ashes, having gone forth and having poured down (the wash-water) for the Apyas, he carries the Stambayajus. (The rite) is prescribed in the Pauroḍašika Brāhmaṇa. (He carries the Stambayajus) three times with the formula and the fourth time silently. He does the first tracing out of the altar; murmurs the Karana formula,3 digs out (the altar). The Agnīdhra carries the earth three times from the dug out spot.
When the Agnidhra carries three times, he draws around a line for the Carvala with the procedure for Cätväla.1 He pours down earth for the Uttaravedi with the procedure for Uttaravedi. Having carved out the Uttaranābhi, he carries forth the fires with the procedure for carrying fire.5 Having done the second tracing out of the altar after the fire has been deposited on the Uttaravedi, having levelled (the altar), having held up the wooden sword crosswise, he gives out the call, “Do you keep down the Prokṣani-waters, place the faggot and sacrificial grass, cleanse the spoon and ladles (with the relevant formulas) and the Prşadajya-ladies silently, girdle the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife and come up with the clarified butter and curds.” After the Prokṣaṇī-water has been brought, having discarded the wooden sword, having sprinkled himself, having placed the faggot and sacrificial grass, turning by the right and hastening to the rear, he cleanses the spoon and the ladles (with the relevant formulas) and the Prṣadājya-ladle silently. Having girdled the sacrificer&rsquo;s wife, having come up with the clarified butter and curds and having purified the clarified butter and Prokṣani-water, he concludes the rites in the manner pre- scribed for Vaisvadeva-offerings except the (offering of) whey. Having gone through the rite of Pūrṇapātra and Vişņu-strides, (the sacrificer) does not release the vow.

(The sacrificer who) is going to perform the Mahäpitṛyajña procures paddy, barley, six potsherds, half potful of milk of a cow feeding another&rsquo;s calf, two new pots, a stem of sugarcane, three tri-leafs of Butea frondosa, sacrificial grass with roots, a bigger faggot, a curtain, mattress and pillow, collyrium and ointment, a fringe of cloth, wooden sword, two water-pitchers and sacrificial implements. The Adhvaryu strews darbha-blades round the Garhapatya. Towards the north he deposits one by one the mattress and pillow, collyrium and ointment, a fringe of cloth, the wooden sword, two water-pitchers and sacrificial implements. Having suspended the cord over the left shoulder and having sat down to the north of the Gärhapatya, he pours out by means of the Agnihotra-ladle provided with the strainer. With the formula, &ldquo;In the impulse of god Savity, with the arms of the Asvins, with the hands of Püsan I pour out (the oblation) dear to Pitṛmant Soma&rdquo; he pours out four handfuls of paddy. Repeating the same formula (with the modification), &ldquo;I pour out (the oblation) dear to Barhiṣad Pitrs&rdquo;, he pours out four handfuls of barley. Repeating the same formula (with the modification), &ldquo;I pour out (oblation) dear to Agniṣvätta Pitrs&rdquo; he pours out again four handfuls of barley.
Among these (oblations) he gives out a call to the preparer of oblation - material with regard only to paddy. The barley is taken up. The sacrificer releases speech at the call to the preparer of the oblation-material. The rites upto the crushing of rice-grains is similar. Having crushed the grains, he lays down six potsherds in the southern half of the Gärhapatya fire-place. Having crushed the barley in the mortar, and having placed a potsherd on the Carhapatya fire, they roast it. The barley is roasted out of which half the quantity is turned into roasted grains. Other grains are turned into flour. Having poured the flour (of rice-grains) into the pan and having mixed it with water, he bakes the cake on six potsherds. Having taken away towards the north embers mixed with ashes, having kept a new pot upon them, and having poured into it clarified butter across the strainer, he pours into it the roasted grains across the strainer. He asks for the half potful of milk of a cow feeding another&rsquo;s calf. Having poured into it flour of parched barley across the strainer, he churns it with the stem of sugarcane. He churns by the right. &ldquo;He churns in a detached manner&rdquo;, so says the Brahmana. Having taken out embers mixed with ashes towards the north, he keeps (the pot) on them. Having made the cake catch the crust, he pours down (the wash-water) for the Apyas. A levelled mound is prepared towards the south. Here he draws a square altar, he does not dig it. Having enkindled the Anvähäryapacana fire in the middle of it, he carries the Stambayajus.</p>

When the Agnidhra carries (earth) three times, having done the second tracing of the altar, having levelled (the ground) and having held the wooden sword crosswise, the Adhvaryu calls out, &ldquo;Do you place the Prokṣaṇi-water, keep ready the faggotand sacrificial grass, cleanse the spoon and ladles and come up with the clarified butter.&rdquo; After the Prokṣani-waters have been brought, having thrown the wooden sword, having sprinkled (himself), having kept the faggot and sacrificial grass, having turned by the right and having hastened to the west, he cleanses the spoon and the ladles. Having come up with the clarified butter, having purified the clarified butter and the Prokṣaṇī-waters, having taken up five spoonfuls or six spoonfulls of clarified butter in the ladles, he stands up with Prokṣani-waters. He sprinkles the faggot, sprinkles the altar and sprinkles the sacrificial grass.

After the fire has been cleansed,1 he offers the second Āghāra-libation by means of the two ladles. Having crossed the altar towards the north without bringing the two ladles in mutual contact, having anointed the Dhruva with the Juhu and having kept the ladles, he chooses the Pravara.

He pours clarified butter over them; anoints back (the oblations). Having taken the portions while being towards the south, he crosses towards the north. He causes to announce with O Svadha. The Agnidhra responds with astu svadbā. (The Adhvaryu gives call)</li>
<li>Caland&rsquo;s text reads asaya eva dhänā bhavanti. In place of alaya the variants noted are āśayā and saya. The reading saya is acceptable. When roasted grains (dhn) are prepared (cf BaudhŚS V.II) it is not said that they are kept in an adaya. There are three oblations. In transposition Nos. 1 and 3 exchange their positions. The oblation in the middle viz. dhānā remains in its place. This is the meaning of the sûtra layä na diánë bhavanti. The sutra again occurs in BaudhŚS V.14. Here also saya is required to be corrected as sayā. Even if dhānās were kept in a container, the latter has no relevance here. The word aŝaya in the sense of &ldquo;a container&rdquo; occurs in BaudhSS X.7, X.10 in the context of Pravargya utensils, in BaudhŚS XX.12 in the context of care and in XXI 2 in the context of a cake on one potsherd. In ApŚS the word jaye occurs in the above mentioned sense in the context of days in Gavārn Ayana ApŚS XXI. 15.9,14,22:16 2,7.12. In ManŚS the word saya occurs in a different sense. viz. Aratni.</li>

<p>Anu svadhā stands for anu brühi. This is a call to the Hotr to recite the puronuváky Caland (APSS VIII. 15.8) deems these words as untranslatable. While sundhi in untranslatable, anu could be rendered since it stands for anušky, purseunäkyä. I have thought it suitable to render anu as &ldquo;Pre&rdquo; in consideration of the fact that the puronuväkyä is to be recited before the yājyä.

Having spread (clarified butter in the Juhû) while taking portion of Karambha from the rear half, he says (to the Hotṛ) &ldquo;Pre-svadhä for Agniṣvätta Pitṛs.&rdquo; He takes portion of Karmabha from the rear half of the cake from the rear half; of roasted grains from the rear half. He pours clarified butter over them; anoints back (the oblations). Having taken portions while being towards the south, he crosses towards the north. He crosses to announce with O svadha. The Agnidhra responds with astu svadhä.

He utters the Vasat as suadhā namaḥ. (The Adhvaryu) makes the offering at the Vasat (i.e. at svadhā namaḥ). Having spread (clarified butter in the Juhu), while taking portion of the cake from the southern half (the Adhvaryu) says (to the Hotṛ) “Pre-svadhā for Kavyavahana Svistakṛt Agni.&rdquo; He takes a portion of the cake from the southern half; of roasted grains from the southern half; of Karambha from the southern half. He pours clarified butter twice. He does not anoint back. Having taken portion while being towards the south, he crosses towards the north. He causes to announce with O svadhä. The Agnidhra responds with astu svadha. (The Adhvaryu gives the call to the Hotṛ), &ldquo;Do you utter svadhä (i.e. recite the yājyä) for Kavyavähana Sviṣṭakṛt Agni,&rdquo; (The Hotṛ utters) the agur as ye spadhā or je svadhāmahe, and utters Vaṣaṭ as svadhā namaḥ. At the utterance of Vaṣaț (i.e. svadhā namaḥ) he makes the offering in the eastern half of the southern half transgressing the earlier offerings.
Here he throws into the fire the corn-stirring stick and the stem (of sugarcane), and pours over them drops (from the Juhů). Having crossed towards the south, he places the ladles in their places. (The priests) suspend their cords over the left shoulder. The priests exchange their positions. The oblations are transposed. The Adhvaryu places the cake towards the south; the Karmabha towards the north. The roasted grains lie in their place. The Brahman and the sacrificer take their seats towards the south; the Adhvaryu and the Agnidhra towards the north. Having cut up the Prasitra portion the Adhvaryu takes up the Iḍā.

After the Iḍā has been invoked, the Adhvaryu gives to the Agnidhra a portion of Iḍā in six portions. The priests having consumed (the Iḍā) by smelling keep it on the sacrificial grass. They suspend their cords over the right shoulder. (The Adhvaryu) mixes together in a pan the cake, roasted grains and Karambha.
