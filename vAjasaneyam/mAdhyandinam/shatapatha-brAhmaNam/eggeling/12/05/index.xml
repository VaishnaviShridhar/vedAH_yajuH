      <description>01 They also say, &amp;lsquo;If that performer of a long sacrificial session&amp;ndash;to wit, he who (regularly) offers the Agnihotra&amp;ndash;were to die whilst staying abroad, are they to sacrifice for him or not?&amp;rsquo; Now, some indeed think that (his Agnihotra) should be offered till they get home 1; but let him not do so, for that (fire) does not submit thereto that they should offer to it, as for the burning of a dead body: it is rather to sacrifice and oblations that it submits, and, unable to endure it, it stays by him with impatience.</description>

      <description>01 Now, Nāka Maudgalya once said, &amp;lsquo;If he believe the Sacrificer to be about to die, let him take up the two fires in the churning-sticks, and, having churned out (a new fire), let him continue offering (the Agnihotra) at whatever place may have commended itself to him for the immolation 1. And if the Sacrificer should then depart this world,&amp;ndash;
02 Let him build a pile for him 2 in the midst of his fires, and, by burning him, unite him with his fires.</description>
