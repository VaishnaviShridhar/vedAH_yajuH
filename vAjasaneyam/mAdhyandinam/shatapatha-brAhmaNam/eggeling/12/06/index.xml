      <description>01 Verily, Prajāpati, the sacrifice, is King Soma; and these deities to whom he offers, and these oblations which he offers, are forms of him. 02 If any part of the sacrifice were to fail, let him make an oblation with regard to that same deity for whom he may have intended (that part),&amp;ndash;on the Āhavanīya, if it is during the initiation and the Upasads; on the Āgnīdhra, if it is at the Soma-pressing;&amp;ndash;for whatever joint of the sacrifice fails, that breaks; and whichever then is the deity in that (part of the sacrifice) through that deity he heals the sacrifice, through that one he makes the sacrifice complete again 1.</description>
