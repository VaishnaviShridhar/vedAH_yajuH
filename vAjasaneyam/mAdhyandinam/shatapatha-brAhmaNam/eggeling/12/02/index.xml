      <description>01 Verily, those who become initiated for (a sacrificial session of) a year cross an ocean: the Prāyaṇīya Atirātra is a flight of steps 1, for it is by means of a flight of steps that one enters (the water); and when they enter on the Prāyaṇīya Atirātra it is just as if they were entering the ocean by a flight of steps.
02 The Caturviṁśa day is (in the form of) a foothold, a shallow place 2, such a one as (where the water reaches) either to the arm-pits or to the neck, whence, having rested, they enter 3 (the deep water).</description>

      <description>01 Here, now, they say, &amp;lsquo;Whereby are the Abhiplavas possessed of light (jyotis) on both sides 1, and the Pr̥shṭḥya of light on one side only?&amp;rsquo; Well, the Abhiplavas are these worlds, and these worlds are indeed possessed of light on both sides&amp;ndash;through the fire on this side, and through the sun on yonder side; and the Pr̥shṭḥya is the seasons, and the seasons are indeed possessed, of light on one side only: he who burns yonder (the sun) is their light.</description>

      <description>01 That year, doubtless, amounts to a Br̥hatī&amp;ndash;,there are two shaḍahas (12) of winning days 1; the two, Pr̥shṭḥya and Abhiplava (12); the Go and Āyus, and the Daśarātra (ten days)&amp;ndash;that makes thirty-six; for the Br̥hatī consists of thirty-six syllables, and by means of the Br̥hatī the gods strove to reach heaven, and by the Br̥hatī they did gain heaven; and in like manner does this one, by means of the Br̥hatī, now strive to reach heaven, and thereby gain heaven; he who knows this secures for himself whatever wish there is in the Br̥hatī.</description>

      <description>01 The Year, indeed, is Man;&amp;ndash;the Prāyaṇīya Atirātra is his breath, for by means of the breath men go forward (prayanti); and the Ārambhaṇīya (opening) day 1 is speech, for by means of speech men undertake (ārabh) whatever they do undertake.
02 The Abhiplava-shaḍaha is this right hand 2. This (little finger) is the first day thereof,&amp;ndash;this (upper joint 3)is its morning-service, this (middle joint) its midday-service, and this (lower joint) its evening-service: it is in place of the Gāyatrī, whence this (little finger) is the shortest of these (fingers).</description>
