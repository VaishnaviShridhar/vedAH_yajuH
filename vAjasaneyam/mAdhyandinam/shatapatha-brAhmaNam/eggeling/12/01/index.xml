      <description>01 Verily, this sacrifice is the same as this blowing (wind): it is that 1 they wish to secure who take the vow of initiation for a year. Of them the Gr̥hapati is initiated first 2; for the Gr̥hapati is this (terrestrial) world, and upon this world everything here is established; and so, indeed, are his fellow-sacrificers established in the Gr̥hapati: it is thus after they have become established on a firm foundation that they are initiated.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, from out of faith the gods fashioned the initiation, from out of Aditi the opening (sacrifice 1), from out of Soma the buying (of Soma-plants), from out of Vishṇu the guest-offering, from out of the sun the Pravargya, from out of the Svadhā (the food of departed ancestors) the Upasads, from out of Agni and Soma the day of fasting, and from out of this world the opening Atirātra 2.</description>

      <description>01 Now, when they are initiated they indeed offer sacrifice to the deities Agni and Vishṇu: they become the deities Agni and Vishṇu, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Agni and Vishṇu. 02 And when they perform the opening sacrifice they indeed offer sacrifice to the deity Aditi: they become the deity Aditi, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Aditi. 03 And when they proceed with the buying (of Soma-plants) they indeed offer sacrifice to the deity Soma: they become the deity Soma, and attain to fellowship and co-existence with Soma.</description>

      <description>01 The Year, indeed, is Man;&amp;ndash;the opening (prāyaṇīya) Atirātra is his feet, for by means of their feet (men) go forward (prayanti): that part of them which is white is of the form of the day, and that which is black is (of the form) of the night; the nails are of the form of herbs and trees. The Caturviṁśa day is the thighs, the Abhiplava the breast, and the Pr̥shṭḥya the back.</description>
