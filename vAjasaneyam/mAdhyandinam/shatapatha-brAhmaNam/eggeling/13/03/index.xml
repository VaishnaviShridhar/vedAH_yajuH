      <description>01 Now, then, of the expiations. If the sacrificial horse were to couple with a mare, let him in addition prepare a milk (oblation) to Vāyu;&amp;ndash;Vāyu doubtless is the transformer of seeds, for Vāyu (the wind) is the vital air, and the vital air is the transformer of seeds: by means of seed he thus puts seed into it.
02 And if disease were to befal it, let him in addition prepare a pap to Pūshan, for Pūshan rules over beasts (cattle); and, indeed, he thereby gratifies him who owns cattle and rules over cattle; and it (the horse) thereby indeed becomes free from disease.</description>

      <description>01 Prajāpati&amp;rsquo;s eye swelled; it fell out: thence the horse was produced; and inasmuch as it swelled (aśvayat), that is the origin and nature of the horse (aśva). By means of the Aśvamedha the gods restored it to its place; and verily he who performs the Aśvamedha makes Prajāpati complete, and he (himself) becomes complete; and this, indeed, is the atonement for everything, the remedy for everything. Thereby the gods redeem all sin, yea, even the slaying of a Brahman 1 they thereby redeem; and he who performs the Aśvamedha redeems all sin, he redeems the slaying of a Brahman.</description>

      <description>01 Now this (Sacrificer), having- conquered by means of the supreme Stoma&amp;ndash;the Katushṭoma, the Kr̥ta among dice 1,&amp;ndash;on the next day establishes himself on the Ekaviṁśa 2, as a firm foundation: from the Ekaviṁśa, as a firm foundation, he subsequently ascends to the next day, the seasons; for the Pr̥shṭḥa (-stotras) are the seasons, and the seasons are the year: it is in the seasons, in the year, he establishes himself.</description>

      <description>01 Inasmuch as there are three Anushṭubh verses 1 (on the first day), therefore the horse, when standing, stands on three (feet); and inasmuch as (they are made into) four Gāyatrī verses, therefore the horse, when stepping out, scampers off on all (four) feet. For that Anushṭubh, doubtless, is the highest metre, and the horse is the highest of animals; and the Katushṭoma is the highest of Stomas: by means of what is highest he thus causes him (the Sacrificer) to reach the highest position.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, the horse is slaughtered for all the deities: were he to make it one belonging to Prajāpati (exclusively), he would deprive the deities who are co-sharers of their share. Having made ghee (to take the part of) portions (of the horse&amp;rsquo;s body) he makes oblations 1 to the deities in mentioning them one by one with (Vāj. S. XXV, 1-9), &amp;lsquo;The Grass (I gratify) with the teeth, the Lotus with the roots of the hair, .</description>

      <description>01 Verily, there are deaths 1 connected with all the worlds; and were he not to offer oblations to them, Death would get hold of him in every world: when he offers oblations to the Deaths 2, he wards off Death in every world.
02 Concerning this they say, &amp;lsquo;If, in offering, he were to name them all, saying, &amp;ldquo;To such 3 (a death) hail! To such (a death) hail!&amp;rdquo; he would make that manifold death his enemy 4, and would give himself over to Death.</description>

      <description>01 When the horse was slaughtered, the life-sap 1 went out of it; it became the Aśvastomīya (set of oblations 2): when he offers the Aśvastomīya (oblations) he indeed supplies the horse with life-sap. 02 He performs it with ghee; for ghee is life-sap, and the Aśvastomīya is life-sap: by means of life-sap he thus puts life-sap into it. He performs with ghee, for that&amp;ndash;to wit, ghee&amp;ndash;is the favourite resource of the gods: he thus supplies them with their favourite resource.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, this is the sacrifice called Strengthful: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes strong. 02 Verily, this is the sacrifice called Plenteous: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes plentiful. 03 Verily, this is the sacrifice called Obtainment: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes obtained. 04 Verily, this is the sacrifice called Distinction: wherever they worship with this sacrifice, everything indeed becomes distinct 1.</description>
