      <description>01 Prajāpati set his mind upon Agni&amp;rsquo;s forms. He searched for that boy (Kumāra) who had entered into the (different) forms. Agni became aware of it,&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Surely, Father Prajāpati is searching for me: well then, let me be suchlike that he knows me not.&amp;rsquo;
02 He saw those five animals,&amp;ndash;the Purusha (man), the horse, the bull, the ram, and the he-goat. Inasmuch as he saw (paś) them, they are (called) cattle (paśu).</description>

      <description>01 The Carakas slaughter (a he-goat) for Prajāpati, saying, &amp;lsquo;Prajāpati, having built up the fire-altar (agni), became Agni. When he slaughters that one, then indeed he reaches the end of Agni (the fire-altar).&amp;rsquo; 02 It is a dark grey one; for the grey has two kinds of hair, the white and the black; and two make a productive pair: that is its Prajāpati-characteristic. It is a hornless one, for Prajāpati is hornless.</description>

      <description>01 Now, the gods said, &amp;lsquo;Meditate ye!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;whereby, no doubt, they meant to say, &amp;lsquo;Seek ye a layer 1 (for the fire-altar)! &amp;lsquo;Whilst they were meditating, Prajāpati saw this earth, as a first naturally-perforated 2 layer: hence it is by means of Prajāpati that he lays on that (brick) 3.
02 Agni said to him (Prajāpati), &amp;lsquo;I will step nigh!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Wherewith?&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;With cattle!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;So be it!&amp;rsquo; He thereby doubtless meant to say, &amp;lsquo;with the cattle-brick;&amp;rsquo; for that cattle-brick is the same as the dūrvā-brick 4: hence the dūrvā-brick is laid so as not to be separated from the first naturally-perforated one; hence also not separated from this earth are the plants, the cattle, the fire,&amp;ndash;for not separated (from the earth) 5 he (Agni) stepped nigh with this (brick).</description>
