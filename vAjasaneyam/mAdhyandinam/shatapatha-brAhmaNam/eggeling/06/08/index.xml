      <description>01 &amp;lsquo;Let him drive Agni about while keeping him up, so they say. The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprung from Prajāpati, were contending. The gods drove about on wheels (cars), and the Asuras stayed at home. The gods, while driving about on wheels, saw 1 this rite (sacrificial performance), for it was indeed in driving about on wheels that they saw this rite: hence it is to the cart that the formulas relate at the (performance with) sacrificial cakes 2, and to the cart in the building of the fire-altar 3.</description>

      <description>01 Now, then, as to the taking down of the ashes (to the water 1). Now, the gods at that time threw out the ashes (from the pan). They said, &amp;lsquo;If we make this, such as it is, part of our own self, we shall become mortal carcases, not freed from sin; and if we cast it away, we shall put outside of Agni what therein is of Agni&amp;rsquo;s nature: find ye out in what manner we shall do this!</description>
