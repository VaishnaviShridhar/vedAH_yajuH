      <description>01 That water (used for working the clay) has been boiled by means of resin of the palāśa tree (butea frondosa), just for the sake of firmness. And as to why (it is done) by palāśa resin;&amp;ndash;the palāśa tree doubtless is Soma 1, and Soma is the moon, and that (moon) indeed is one of Agni&amp;rsquo;s forms: it is for the obtainment of that form of Agni (that palāśa resin is used).</description>

      <description>01 He then takes a lump of clay, as much as he thinks sufficient for the bottom part, with, &amp;lsquo;Makha&amp;rsquo;s head thou art!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;Makha, doubtless, is the sacrifice, and this is its head; for the Āhavanīya fire is the head of the sacrifice, and that Āhavanīya (fire-altar) he is now about to build: hence he says, &amp;lsquo;Makha&amp;rsquo;s head thou art!&amp;rsquo; 02 And, again, as to why he says, &amp;lsquo;Makha&amp;rsquo;s head thou art!</description>

      <description>01 Of that same (clay) she (the queen) forms the first, the &amp;lsquo;invincible&amp;rsquo; (brick); for the invincible one (Ashāḍḥā) is this earth, and this earth was created first of these worlds. She forms it of that same clay, for this earth is (one) of these worlds. The (Sacrificer&amp;rsquo;s) consecrated consort (mahishī) forms it: for this earth is a &amp;lsquo;mahishī&amp;rsquo; (female buffalo, a cow). She who is first taken to wife is the consecrated consort.</description>

      <description>01 He now digs that (hole) 1 in the earth; for the gods now were afraid, thinking, &amp;lsquo;We hope the Rakshas, the fiends, will not smite here this (Agni) of ours!&amp;rsquo; They made this (earth) to be his self (body), for protection, thinking, &amp;lsquo;The self will protect itself.&amp;rsquo;
02 He digs him out with (the help of) Aditi, in order to guard him from injury; for Aditi is this earth, and one does not injure one&amp;rsquo;s own self; but were he to dig with (the help of) another deity, he surely would injure him (Agni).</description>
