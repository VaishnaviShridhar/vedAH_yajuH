      <description>01 Verily, in the beginning there was here the non-existent 1. As to this they say, &amp;lsquo;What was that non-existent?&amp;rsquo; The R̥shis, assuredly,&amp;ndash;it is they that were the non-existent 2. As to this they say, &amp;lsquo;Who were those R̥shis?&amp;rsquo; The R̥shis, doubtless, were the vital airs: inasmuch as before (the existence of) this universe, they, desiring it, wore themselves out (rish) with toil and austerity, therefore (they are called) R̥shis. 02 This same vital air in the midst doubtless is Indra.</description>

      <description>01 That Prajāpati desired, &amp;lsquo;May it multiply, may it be reproduced!&amp;rsquo; By means (or, in the form) of Agni he entered into union with the Earth: thence an egg arose. He touched it: &amp;lsquo;May it grow! May it grow and multiply!&amp;rsquo; he said. 02 And the embryo which was inside was created as Vāyu (the wind). And the tear which had formed itself became those birds. And the juice which was adhering to the shell became those sun-motes.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, Prajāpati alone was here in the beginning. He desired, &amp;lsquo;May I exist, may I reproduce myself!&amp;rsquo; He toiled, he practised austerity (or, became heated). From him, worn out and heated, the waters were created: from that heated Person the waters are born. 02 The waters said, &amp;lsquo;What is to become of us?&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Ye shall be heated,&amp;rsquo; he said. They were heated; they created foam: hence foam is produced in heated water.</description>
