      <description>01 Now, then, as to the taking of milk as fast-food: the initiated should take milk for his fast-food. Once upon a time the nectar of immortality departed from the gods. 02 They said, &amp;lsquo;Let us seek for it here by toil and penance!&amp;rsquo; They sought for it by toil and penance. Having become initiated, they were living on fast-milk, for penance it is when, after becoming initiated, one lives on fast-milk.</description>

And, indeed, after building the fire-altar, one is (still) apt to get into trouble, or to stumble, or what not. Now, when Śyāparṇa Sāyakāyana heard this, he ventured upon this performance. 02 Now, there is here a perfecting of three things,&amp;ndash;the perfecting of the fire-altar, the perfecting of him who has it built for him, and the perfecting of him who builds it.</description>
