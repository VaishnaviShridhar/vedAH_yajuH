For the gods, having now appeased him by the Śatarudriya, thereby appeased him still further; and in like manner does this (Sacrificer), now that he has appeased him by the Śatarudriya, still further appease him thereby. 02 With water he sprinkles him 1,&amp;ndash;water is a means of appeasing (soothing): he thus appeases him thereby. He sprinkles him all over; he thus appeases him all over.</description>
