      <description>01 In the enclosed space (of the cart) 1 he (the Adhvaryu) lays down the black deer-skin, with the text (Vāj. S. IV, 30), &amp;lsquo;Thou art Aditi&amp;rsquo;s skin;&amp;rsquo; its significance is the same (as before) 2. Thereon he places him (Soma), with, &amp;lsquo;Seat thee on Aditi&amp;rsquo;s seat!&amp;rsquo; for Aditi being this (earth), and she being indeed a safe resting-place, he thereby places him on that safe resting-place: therefore he says, &amp;lsquo;Seat thee on Aditi&amp;rsquo;s seat!</description>

      <description>01 Having thrown the (earth of the) foot-print (into the pan), he (the Adhvaryu) washes his hands. Now as to why he washes his hands;&amp;ndash;clarified butter being a thunderbolt, and the Soma being seed, he washes his hands lest 1 he should injure the seed, Soma, with the thunderbolt, the ghee. 02 Thereupon he ties the piece of gold to this (finger 2). Now, twofold indeed is this (universe),&amp;ndash;there is no third,&amp;ndash;the truth and the untruth: the gods are the truth and men are the untruth.</description>

      <description>01 He follows her, stepping into seven foot-prints of hers 1; he thereby takes possession of her: that is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints. For when the metres were produced from Vāc (speech), the one consisting of seven feet, the Śakvarī, was the last (highest) of them. It is that (metre) he now draws down towards himself from above: this is why he steps into seven of her foot-prints.</description>

      <description>01 He bargains for the king (Soma); and because he bargains for the king, therefore any and everything is vendible here. He says, &amp;lsquo;Soma-seller, is thy king Soma for sale?&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;He is for sale,&amp;rsquo; says the Soma-seller.&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;I will buy him of thee!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Buy him!&amp;rsquo; says the Soma-seller.&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;I will buy him of thee for one-sixteenth (of the cow).&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;King Soma, surely, is worth more than that!&amp;rsquo; says the Soma-seller.&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Yea, King Soma is worth more than that; but great, surely, is the greatness of the cow,&amp;rsquo; says the Adhvaryu.</description>
