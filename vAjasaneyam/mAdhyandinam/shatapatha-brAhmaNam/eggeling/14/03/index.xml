      <description>01 Now this&amp;ndash;to wit, the sacrifice&amp;ndash;is the self of all beings, and of all gods: after its successful consummation the Sacrificer prospers in offspring (or, people) and cattle; but he whose Gharma (pot) is shattered is deprived of his offspring and cattle. In that case there is an expiation. 02 He offers an oblation of a full (spoon of ghee); for the full means everything: with everything he thus heals whatever has been unsuccessful in the sacrifice.</description>

      <description>01 Now, on the third, or the sixth, or the twelfth day 1, having combined (the two performances of) the Pravargya and Upasads 2, he &amp;lsquo;sets out 3&amp;rsquo; the Pravargya, for set out (removed), as it were, is this head (from the trunk). Having gathered together all around it 4 (the Mahāvīra pot), they meet together upon the Vedi in the Śālā, (entering) by the front door.
02 The Āgnīdhra then brings three bundles of faggots to the Āhavanīya, and kindling one of them, he offers (thereon) whilst holding it 5 on a level with (the Sacrificer&amp;rsquo;s) mouth.</description>
