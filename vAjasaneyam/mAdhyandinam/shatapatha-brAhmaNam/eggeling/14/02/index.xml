      <description>01 He now offers (the first of) the two Rauhiṇa (cakes) 1:&amp;ndash;(Vāj. S. XXXVII, 21), &amp;lsquo;May the day be pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!&amp;rsquo; with this text both (cakes are offered) in the morning;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;May the night be pleased with its brightness, the well-lighted with its light, hail!&amp;rsquo; with this text both (cakes are offered) in the evening.
02 And as to why he offers two Rauhiṇa (cakes),&amp;ndash;the two Rauhiṇas doubtless are Agni and Āditya (the sun), for by means of these two deities sacrificers ascend (ruh) to heaven.</description>

      <description>01 And when the Hotr̥ recites this (verse), &amp;lsquo;Let Brahmaṇaspati go forward, let the goddess Sūnr̥tā go forward,&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;the Adhvaryu, stepping forward, makes offering (by muttering) the wind-names. For at this time the gods were afraid lest the Rakshas, the fiends, might injure that (Pravargya) of theirs in the middle (of the sacrifice): they offered it with the Svāhā-call before (its being taken to) the Āhavanīya, being thus offered they offered it (again) in the fire; and in like manner does this one now offer it with the Svāhā-call before (its being taken to) the Āhavanīya, and being thus offered he offers it (again) in the fire.</description>
