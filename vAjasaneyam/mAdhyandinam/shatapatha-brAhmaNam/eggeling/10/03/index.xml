      <description>01 The Gāyatrī is the breath (of Prajāpati, the altar), the Ushṇih the eye, the Anushṭubh the voice, the Br̥hatī the mind, the Paṅkti the ear; the Trishṭubh is that generative breath; and the Jagatī that downward breathing;&amp;ndash;these are the seven metres increasing by four (syllables) each 1, which are produced in Agni (the fire-altar).
02 &amp;lsquo;The Gāyatrī is the breath,&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;thus, whatever power, whatever vigour there is in the breath that is this one thousand; and to the breath, indeed, this vigour belongs; for were the breath of him who builds it to pass away, this fire-altar, assuredly, would not be built: by this its form that (altar) becomes built (so as to contain) a thousand Gāyatrīs.</description>

      <description>01 Śvetaketu Āruṇeya 1, once upon a time, was about to offer sacrifice.

      <description>01 Now, the Yajus, indeed, is he who blows here, for even whilst passing along he (Vāyu, the wind) generates (vivifies) everything here, and after him passing along everything is generated: this is why the Yajus is no other than Vāyu. 02 And the course 1 (jūḥ) is this space, to wit, this air 2, for along this space it (the wind) courses; and the Yajus is both the wind and the air&amp;ndash;the &amp;lsquo;yat&amp;rsquo; and the &amp;lsquo;jūḥ&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;whence (the name) Yajus.</description>
