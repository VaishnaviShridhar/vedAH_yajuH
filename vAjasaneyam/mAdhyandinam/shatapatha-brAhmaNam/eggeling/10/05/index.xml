      <description>01 The mystic import of this Fire-altar, doubtless, is Speech; for it is with speech that it is built: with the R̥c, the Yajus and the Sāman as the divine (speech); and when he (the Adhvaryu) speaks with human speech, &amp;lsquo;Do ye this! do ye that!&amp;rsquo; then also it (the altar) is built therewith. 02 Now, this speech is threefold&amp;ndash;the R̥k-verses, the Yajus-formulas, and the Sāman-tunes;&amp;ndash;thereby the Fire-altar is threefold, inasmuch as it is built with that triad.</description>

      <description>01 Now, that shining orb is the Great Litany, the R̥k-verses: this is the world of the R̥c. And that glowing light is (the hymn of) the Great Rite, the Sāman-tunes: this is the world of the Sāman. And the man in yonder orb is the Fire-altar, the Yajus-formulas: this is the world of the Yajus. 02 It is this threefold lore that shines, and even they who do not know this say, &amp;lsquo;This threefold lore does indeed shine;&amp;rsquo; for it is Speech that, seeing it, speaks thus.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, in the beginning this (universe) was, as it were 1, neither non-existent nor existent; in the beginning this (universe), indeed, as it were, existed and did not exist: there was then only that Mind.
02 Wherefore it has been said by the R̥shi (R̥g-veda X, 129, 1), &amp;lsquo;There was then neither the non-existent nor the existent;&amp;rsquo; for Mind was, as it were, neither existent nor non-existent. 03 This Mind, when created, wished to become manifest,&amp;ndash;more defined 2, more substantial: it sought after a self (body) 3.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, this (brick-)built Fire-altar (Agni) is this (terrestrial) world:&amp;ndash;the waters (of the encircling ocean) are its (circle of) enclosing-stones; the men its Yajushmatīs (bricks with special formulas); the cattle its Sūdadohas 1; the plants and trees its earth-fillings (between the layers of bricks), its oblations and fire-logs 2; Agni (the terrestrial fire) its Lokampr̥ṇā (space-filling brick);&amp;ndash;thus this comes to make up the whole Agni, and the whole Agni comes to be the space-filler 3; and, verily, whosoever knows this, thus comes to be that whole (Agni) who is the space-filler 4.</description>

      <description>01 Kuśri Vājaśravasa 1 once built a fire-altar. Suśravas Kaushya then said to him, &amp;lsquo;Gautama, when thou wert just now building up Agni, didst thou build him with his face forward, or backward, or downward, or upward?&amp;rsquo; 02 &amp;lsquo;If perchance thou hast built him looking forward, it would be just as if one were to offer food from behind to one sitting with averted face 2: he thereby will not receive thy offering.</description>
