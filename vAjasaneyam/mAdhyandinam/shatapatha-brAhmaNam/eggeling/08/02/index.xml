      <description>01 He lays down the second layer. For now the gods, having laid down the first layer, mounted it. But, indeed, the first layer is this (terrestrial) world: it is this same world which, when completed, they mounted.
02 They spake, &amp;lsquo;Meditate ye!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, &amp;lsquo;Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!&amp;rsquo; Whilst meditating, they saw this second layer: what there is above the earth, and on this side of the atmosphere, that world was to their mind, as it were, unfirm and unsettled.</description>

      <description>01 He then lays down the Vaiśvadevī (All-gods’ bricks). For this second layer is that one which the Aśvins at that time laid down for them (the gods); and by laying it down they became everything here whatsoever there is here. 02 The gods spake, &amp;lsquo;The Aśvins have become everything here: think ye upon this as to how we also may share in it!&amp;rsquo; They said, &amp;lsquo;Meditate ye (cit)!&amp;rsquo; whereby, no doubt, they meant to say, Seek ye a layer (citi)!</description>

      <description>01 He then lays down the Prāṇabhr̥t (bricks). For at that time the gods said, &amp;lsquo;Meditate ye!&amp;rsquo; whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, &amp;lsquo;Seek ye a layer!&amp;rsquo; Whilst meditating, they saw even that layer, the wind: they put it into that (fire-altar), and in like manner does he (the priest) now put it therein. 02 He lays down the Prāṇabhr̥ts,&amp;ndash;wind, doubtless, is breath: it is wind (air) he thus bestows Upon him (Agni).</description>
