      <description>01 He lays down the fourth layer. For the gods having laid down the third layer, now ascended; but, the third layer being the air; it was the air which, having completed it, they ascended. 02 They spake, &amp;lsquo;Meditate ye!&amp;rsquo; whereby, indeed, they meant to say, &amp;lsquo;Seek ye a layer! Seek ye (to build) from hence upwards!&amp;rsquo; Whilst meditating, they saw that fourth layer, (to wit) what is above the air and below the heavens; that world was to their minds, as it were, unstable and unsettled.</description>

      <description>01 He then lays down the Spr̥taḥ 1 (freeing bricks). For when that (part) of his body had been restored, Prajāpati became pregnant with all beings: whilst they were in his womb, evil, death, seized them.
02 He spake to the gods, &amp;lsquo;With you I will free all these beings from evil, from death 2!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;What will accrue unto us therefrom?&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Choose ye!&amp;rsquo; said he.&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Let there be a share for us!&amp;rsquo; said some to him.</description>

      <description>01 He then lays down the Srishṭis 1 (creations). For Prajāpati, having freed all beings from evil, from death, he now desired, &amp;lsquo;May I produce creatures, may I procreate!&amp;rsquo;
02 He spake unto the vital airs 2, &amp;lsquo;Together with you, I will here bring forth creatures!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Wherewith shall we sing praises 3?&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;With me and with yourselves!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;So be it!&amp;rsquo; So they sang praises both with the vital airs and with Prajāpati; and whatsoever the gods do, that they do with praise, that&amp;ndash;praise being sacrifice&amp;ndash;they do with sacrifice.</description>

      <description>01 Now, then, as to the order of proceeding. That (brick) which contains the Trivr̥t (thrice-threefold stoma) he places in front, that containing the twenty-one-fold (stoma) at the back, that containing the fifteenfold (stoma) on the right (south) side, that containing the seventeenfold (stoma) on the left (north) side. 02 Now when the one containing the Trivr̥t had been laid down, Death lay in wait for Prajāpati in the one (on the south side) containing the fifteenfold (stoma), thinking, &amp;lsquo;After that he will lay down this one: I will here seize upon him!</description>
