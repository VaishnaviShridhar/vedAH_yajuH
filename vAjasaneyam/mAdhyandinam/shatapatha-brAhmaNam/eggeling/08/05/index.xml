      <description>01 He lays down the fifth layer. For now, having laid down the fourth layer, the gods mounted it,&amp;ndash;having completed what is above the air, and below the sky, they mounted it. 02 They spake, &amp;lsquo;Meditate ye (cetay)!&amp;rsquo; whereby, doubtless, they meant to say, &amp;lsquo;Seek ye a layer (citi)! Seek ye from hence upwards!&amp;rsquo; Whilst meditating, they saw that fifth layer, the far-shining heaven: that world pleased them. 03 They desired, &amp;lsquo;Would that we could make that world foeless, undisturbed!</description>

      <description>01 He then lays down those Cḥandasyās 1 (relating to the metres). For Prajāpati, having freed himself from evil, death, asked for food; hence, to this day, a sick man, when he gets better, asks for food; and people have hope for him, thinking, &amp;lsquo;He asks for food, he will live.&amp;rsquo; The gods gave him that food, these (bricks) relating to the metres; for the metres are cattle, and cattle are food.</description>

      <description>01 He lays them down on the range of the Ashāḍḥā; for the Ashāḍḥā is speech, and this (set of bricks 1) is the essence (of food): he thus lays into speech the essence of food; whence it is through (the channel of) speech that one distinguishes the essence of food for all the limbs. 02 And, again, as to why (on the range) of the Ashāḍḥā;&amp;ndash;the Ashāḍḥā, doubtless, is this (earth), and the Stomabhāgās are yonder sun: he thus establishes yonder sun upon this earth as a firm foundation.</description>
