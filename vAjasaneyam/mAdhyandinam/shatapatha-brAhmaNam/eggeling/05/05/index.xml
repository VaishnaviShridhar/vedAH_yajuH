      <description>01 When he has performed the Consecration-ceremony (Abhishecanīya), he does not shave his hair. The reason why he does not shave his hair (is this):&amp;ndash;that collected essence of the waters wherewith he is then sprinkled (anointed) is vigour, and it is the hair (of his head) that it reaches first when he is sprinkled; hence were he to shave his hair, he would cause that glory to fall off from him, and would sweep it away: therefore he does not shave his hair.</description>

      <description>01 There is a reddish-white (he-goat as the victim) for the Aśvins 1, for the Aśvins are reddish-white. There is an ewe with teats in the dewlap 2 for Sarasvatī; and a bull he seizes for Indra Sutrāman (the good protector) 3. Difficult to obtain are beasts with such perfections; if he cannot obtain any with such perfections, they may slaughter only goats, for they are easier to cook. And if they seize only goats, that for the Aśvins is a red one.</description>

      <description>01 There is a cake on eight potsherds for Agni: this he places on the eastern part (of the Vedi). There is either a cake on eleven potsherds for Indra, or a rice-pap for Soma: this he places on the southern part. There is a pap for the Viśve Devāḥ (All-gods): this he places on the western part. There is a dish of curds for Mitra-Varuṇa: this he places on the north part.</description>

      <description>01 He performs the oblations of teams (prayujāṁ havīṁshi). The reason why he performs the oblations of teams, is that the anointed thereby yokes the seasons, and thus yoked those seasons draw him along, and he follows the seasons thus yoked: therefore he performs the oblations of teams. 02 There are twelve of these (oblations), for there are twelve months in the year: that is why there are twelve. &amp;lsquo;Let him make offering month by month,&amp;rsquo; they say.</description>

      <description>01 He prepares a cake on twelve potsherds for Indra and Vishṇu. Now as to why he makes this offering. Of old, everything here was within Vr̥tra, to wit, the R̥c, the Yajus, and the Sāman. Indra wished to hurl the thunderbolt at him. 02 He said to Vishṇu, &amp;lsquo;I will hurl the thunderbolt at Vr̥tra, stand thou by me!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;So be it!&amp;rsquo; said Vishṇu, &amp;lsquo;I will stand by thee: hurl it!</description>
