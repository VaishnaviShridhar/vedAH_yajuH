      <description>01 He now separates the two spoons (juhū and upabhr̥t), with the text (Vāj. S. II, 15 a), &amp;lsquo;May I be victorious after the victory of Agni and Soma! with the impetus of the (sacrificial) food I urge myself on.&amp;rsquo; With his right hand he moves the juhū eastwards (from its usual place on the prastara-bunch upon the altar), with the text (ib. b), &amp;lsquo;May Agni and Soma drive him away who hates us, and whom we hate!</description>

      <description>01 They now remove two burning samidhs (from the Āhavanīya fire). That fire, indeed, is now worn out, (and therefore useless) for the after-offerings, since it has been carrying the sacrifice to the gods: &amp;lsquo;Let us perform the after-offerings in such (fire) as is not out-worn!&amp;rsquo; thus they think, and for this reason they remove those two burning samidhs (from the fire). 02 Thereupon they again move them close (to the fire).</description>

When he was washing himself, a fish came into his hands. 02 It spake to him the word, &amp;lsquo;Rear me, I will save thee!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Wherefrom wilt thou save me?&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;A flood will carry away all these creatures 2: from that I will save thee!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;How am I to rear thee?</description>
