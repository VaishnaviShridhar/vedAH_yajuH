      <description>01 [The Hotr̥ continues], &amp;lsquo;May Agni, the priest (hotr̥), know (undertake) Agni&amp;rsquo;s priestly duty (hautram),&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;thereby he says &amp;lsquo;may Agni, as Hotr̥, know this!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Agni&amp;rsquo;s priestly duty&amp;rsquo; he says, because it is his duty that he must know;&amp;ndash;&amp;rsquo;that means of salvation 1,&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;the means of salvation, assuredly, is the sacrifice: &amp;lsquo;may he know the sacrifice&amp;rsquo; is what he thereby says.&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Favourable to thee, O Sacrificer, is the deity!&amp;rsquo; by this he says &amp;lsquo;favourable is the deity to thee, O Sacrificer, whose Hotr̥ is Agni 2!</description>

      <description>01 He (the Adhvaryu) now utters his call for the Pravara (choosing of the Hotr̥) 1. The reason why he utters his call, is that the (Adhvaryu&amp;rsquo;s) call is the sacrifice: &amp;lsquo;having bespoke the sacrifice, I will choose the Hotr̥,&amp;rsquo; thus (he thinks, and) for this reason he utters his call for the Pravara.
02 He utters his call after taking the fuel-band; for if the Adhvaryu were to utter his call without taking hold of the sacrifice, he would either be unsteady or meet with some other ailment.</description>

      <description>01 The fore-offerings (prayāja), assuredly, are the seasons: hence there are five of them, for there are five seasons. 02 The gods and the Asuras, both of them sprang from Prajāpati, were once contending for this sacrifice, (which is) their father Prajāpati, the year: &amp;lsquo;Ours it (he) shall be!&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;Ours it (he) shall be!&amp;rsquo; they said. 03 Then the gods went on praising and toiling. They saw these fore-offerings and worshipped with them.</description>

      <description>01 He (accordingly) pronounces the offering-prayer to the Samidhs (kindling-sticks). The Samidhs (kindlers), doubtless, are the breaths (vital airs), and he thereby kindles the breaths; for this man (the sacrificer) is kindled (animated) by his breaths: hence if he (the sacrificer) be burning (with fever, &amp;amp;c.), he (the Adhvaryu) will say, &amp;lsquo;Stroke (thyself)!&amp;rsquo; If he be hot, then one may feel confident, for then he is kindled; and if he be cold, then one need hope no longer.</description>
