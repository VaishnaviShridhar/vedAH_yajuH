      <description>The ceremonies begin with the preparation of the sacrificial fires. [First, the fivefold lustration successively of the Āhavanīya and Dakshiṇāgni fire-places, to render them fit for receiving the fire from the Gārhapatya or householder&amp;rsquo;s fire, viz. by thrice sweeping the hearths; thrice besmearing them with gomaya; drawing three lines across them from west to east, or south to north, with the wooden sword (sphya); removing the dust from the lines with the thumb and ring-finger; and thrice sprinkling the lines with water 1.</description>

      <description>01 Thereupon he takes the winnowing basket and the Agnihotra ladle 1, with the text (Vāj. S. I, 6 b): &amp;lsquo;For the work (I take) you, for pervasion (or accomplishment) you two!&amp;rsquo; For the sacrifice is a work: hence, in saying &amp;lsquo;for the work you two,&amp;rsquo; he says, &amp;lsquo;for the sacrifice.&amp;rsquo; And &amp;lsquo;for pervasion you two,&amp;rsquo; he says, because he, as it were, pervades (goes through, accomplishes) the sacrifice.
02 He then restrains his speech; for (restrained) speech means undisturbed sacrifice; so that (in so doing) he thinks: &amp;lsquo;May I accomplish the sacrifice!</description>

      <description>01 He now prepares two strainers (pavitra) 1, with the text (Vāj. S. I, 12 a): &amp;lsquo;Purifiers (or strainers, pavitra) are ye, and belonging to Vishṇu!&amp;rsquo; For Vishṇu is the sacrifice; so that he thereby says, &amp;lsquo;You belong to the sacrifice.&amp;rsquo; 02 Two there are of them: for means of cleansing (pavitra) is this (wind) which here ventilates (pavate); and this, it is true, ventilates as one only; but on entering into man, it becomes a forward and a backward one, and they are these two, to wit, the prāṇa (breathing out) and the udāna (breathing up or in) 2.</description>

      <description>01 He now takes the black antelope skin 1, for completeness of the sacrifice. For once upon a time the sacrifice escaped the gods, and having become a black antelope roamed about. The gods having thereupon found it and stripped it of its skin, they brought it (the skin) away with them. 02 Its white and black hairs represent the R̥c-verses and the Sāman-verses; to wit, the white the Sāman and the black the R̥c; or conversely, the black the Sāman and the white the R̥c.</description>
