      <description>01 Now, Bhr̥gu, the son of Varuṇa, deemed himself superior to his father Varuṇa in knowledge 1. Varuṇa became aware of this: &amp;lsquo;He deems himself superior to me in knowledge,&amp;rsquo; he thought. 02 He said, &amp;lsquo;Go thou eastward, my boy; and having seen there what thou shalt see, go thou southwards; and having seen there what thou shalt see, go thou westward; and having seen there what thou shalt see, go thou northward; and having seen there what thou shalt see, go thou toward the northern of those two intermediate quarters in front 2, and tell me then what thou shalt see there.</description>

      <description>01 Now, Janaka of Videha once met some Brāhmaṇas who were travelling about 1, to wit, Śvetaketu Āruṇeya, Somaśushma Sātyayajñi, and Yājñavalkya. He said to them, &amp;lsquo;How do ye each of you perform the Agnihotra?&amp;rsquo; 02 Śvetaketu Āruṇeya replied, &amp;lsquo;O great king, I make offering, in one another, to two heats, never-failing and overflowing with glory.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;How is that?&amp;rsquo; asked the king.&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Well, Āditya (the sun) is heat: to him I make offering in Agni in the evening; and Agni, indeed, is heat: to him I make offering in the morning in Āditya 2.</description>

      <description>01 Janaka of Videha performed a sacrifice accompanied with numerous gifts to the priests. Setting apart a thousand cows, he said, &amp;lsquo;He who is the most learned in sacred writ amongst you, O Brāhmaṇas, shall drive away these (cows) 1!&amp;rsquo; 02 Yājñavalkya then said, &amp;lsquo;This way (drive) them!&amp;rsquo; They said, &amp;lsquo;Art thou really the most learned in sacred writ amongst us, Yājñavalkya?&amp;rsquo; He replied, &amp;lsquo;Reverence be to him who is most learned in sacred writ!</description>
