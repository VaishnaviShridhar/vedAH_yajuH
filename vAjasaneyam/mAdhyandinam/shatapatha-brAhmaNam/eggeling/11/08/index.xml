      <description>01 Verily, even as this cart-wheel, or a potter&amp;rsquo;s wheel, would creak 1 if not steadied, so, indeed, were these worlds unfirm and unsteadied. 02 Prajāpati then bethought him, &amp;lsquo;How may these worlds become firm and steadied?&amp;rsquo; By means of the mountains and rivers he stablished this (earth), by means of the birds and sun-motes 2 the air, and by means of the clouds and stars the sky. 03 He then exclaimed, &amp;lsquo;Wealth!</description>

      <description>01 Verily, there are four kinds of fire,&amp;ndash;the one laid down, the one taken out, the one taken forward, and the one spread (over the three hearths). Now, that which is laid down is this very (terrestrial) world; that which is taken out is the air-world, that which is taken forward is the sky, and that which is spread is the regions. And that which is laid down is Agni, that which is taken out is Vāyu (the wind), that which is taken forward is Āditya (the sun), and that which is spread is Candramas (the moon).</description>

      <description>01 Here, now, they say, &amp;lsquo;To what deity should this victim belong?&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;It should belong to Prajāpati,&amp;rsquo; they say; &amp;lsquo;for it was Prajāpati who first saw it: therefore it is to Prajāpati that this victim should belong.&amp;rsquo; 02 And they also say, &amp;lsquo;To Sūrya (the sun) that victim should belong;&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;whence it is that cattle are tied up when he (the sun) has set: some of them they tie up 1 in their respective stables, and others just flock together:&amp;ndash;&amp;rsquo;therefore,&amp;rsquo; they say, &amp;lsquo;it is to Sūrya that this victim should belong.</description>

      <description>01 Now, once upon a time, a tiger killed the samrāj-cow 1 of those (who were sacrificing) with (the king of the) Keśin as their Gr̥hapati 2. He (the king 3) said to his fellow-sacrificers, &amp;lsquo;What atonement is there for this?&amp;rsquo; They replied, &amp;lsquo;There is no atonement for this: Khaṇḍika Audbhāri alone knows an atonement for it; but he certainly desires as much as this, and worse than this 4, (to happen) to thee.</description>
