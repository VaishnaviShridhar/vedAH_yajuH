      <description>01 Verily, the Agnihotrī cow is the speech of the Agnihotra, and her calf is its mind. Now these two, mind and speech, whilst being one and the same, are, as it were, distinct from each other: therefore they tie up the calf and its mother with one and the same rope; and the fire 1, indeed, is faith, and the ghee truth. 02 Now, as to this Janaka of Videha once asked Yājñavalkya, &amp;lsquo;Knowest thou the Agnihotra, Yājñavalkya?</description>

      <description>01 Verily, whosoever knows the six pairs in the Agnihotra, has offspring born to him by pair after pair, by all generations. The Sacrificer and his wife&amp;ndash;this is one pair: through it his Agnihotra would be possessed of a wife,&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;May I obtain this pair!&amp;rsquo; he thinks 1. The calf and the Agnihotra-cow&amp;ndash;this is another pair: through it his Agnihotra-cow would become possessed of a male calf,&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;May I obtain this pair!&amp;rsquo; he thinks.</description>

      <description>01 The Brahman delivered the creatures over to Death, the Brahmacārin (religious student) alone it did not deliver over to him. He (Death) said, &amp;lsquo;Let me have a share in this one also.&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;&amp;lsquo;Only the night on which he shall not bring his 1 fire-wood,&amp;rsquo; said (the Brahman). On whatever night, therefore, the Brahmacārin does not bring fire-wood, that (night) he passes 2 cutting it off from his own life: therefore the Brahmacārin should bring fire-wood, lest he should pass (his nights) cutting off (as much) from his life.</description>
