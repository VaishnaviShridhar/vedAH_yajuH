      <description>01 Verily, man is born thrice, namely in this way:&amp;ndash;first he is born from his mother and father; and when he to whom the sacrifice inclines performs offering he is born a second time; and when he dies, and they place him on the fire, and when he thereupon comes into existence again, he is born a third time;&amp;ndash;wherefore they say, &amp;lsquo;Man is born thrice.&amp;rsquo;
02 He (the Hotr̥) recites those eleven kindling-verses 1,&amp;ndash;there are these ten vital airs in man, and the body in which these vital airs are established is the eleventh,&amp;ndash;so great, indeed, is man: he thus causes him to be born complete.</description>

      <description>01 He recites a gāyatrī invitatory formula 1: the gāyatrī consisting of three feet, these worlds being three in number 2, it is these worlds the gods thereby established. 02 He offers with a trishṭubh (verse): the trishṭubh consisting of four feet, and cattle being four-footed, it is cattle the gods thereby established in these established worlds. 03 The Vashaṭ-call consists of two syllables (vaushaṭ): man being two-footed; it is two-footed man they thereby established among the established cattle.</description>

      <description>01 Verily, in the beginning, this (universe) was the Brahman (neut.) 1. It created the gods; and, having created the gods, it made them ascend these worlds: Agni this (terrestrial) world, Vāyu the air, and Sūrya the sky. 02 And the deities who are above these he made ascend the worlds which are above these; and, indeed, just as these (three) worlds and these (three) deities are manifest, so are those (higher) worlds and those (higher) deities manifest&amp;ndash;(the worlds) which he made those deities ascend.</description>

      <description>01 The full moon, doubtless, is the same as that burning (sun), for he, indeed, is full day by day; and the new moon (darśa) is the same as the moon, for he appears (darś), as it were. 02 But they also say inversely, &amp;lsquo;The full moon is the same as the moon, for after the filling up of the latter there is the night of full moon;&amp;rsquo; and the new moon (darśa) is the same as that burning (sun), for the latter appears, as it were.</description>

      <description>01 And, verily, even on this occasion 1, they slaughter the sacrificial horse (Aśvamedha) as a sacrifice to the gods: of this (New and Full-moon sacrifice) they say, &amp;lsquo;It is the original (normal) Aśvamedha;&amp;rsquo; and that (real Aśvamedha), indeed, is just the other (modified one); for, indeed, the Aśvamedha is the same as the moon. 02 As to this, they say, &amp;lsquo;For each foot of the sacrificial horse they offer an oblation;&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;when he performs the Agnihotra in the evening and morning, he offers two oblations in the evening, and two in the morning&amp;ndash;that makes four oblations: thus&amp;ndash;the horse being four-footed&amp;ndash;an oblation is offered for each of its feet.</description>

      <description>01 The Praṇītā water, doubtless, is the head of the sacrifice 1; and when he leads forward the Praṇītā water, it is the head of the sacrifice he thereby forms, and he should know that it is that head of his own that is then being formed. 02 The fuel, indeed, is its breath (of the mouth), for it is by the breath that everything here is kindled (animated) that has breath and moves twinkling with its eyelids: let him know that it is he himself that is that fuel.</description>

      <description>01 The Sacrifice is the Year; and, verily, sacrifice is offered at the end of the year of him whoso knows that the sacrifice is the year; and all that is done in the year comes to be gained, secured, and won for him. 02 The officiating priests are the seasons; and, verily, sacrifice is offered at the end of the seasons of him whoso knows that the officiating priests are the seasons; and all that is done in the seasons comes to be gained, secured, and won for him.</description>
