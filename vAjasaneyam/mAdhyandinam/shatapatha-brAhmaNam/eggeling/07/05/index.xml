      <description>01 He then puts down a (living) tortoise;&amp;ndash;the tortoise means life-sap: it is life-sap (blood) he thus bestows on (Agni). This tortoise is that life-sap of these worlds which flowed away from them when plunged into the waters 1: that (life-sap) he now bestows on (Agni). As far as the life-sap extends, so far the body extends: that (tortoise) thus is these worlds. 02 That lower shell of it is this (terrestrial) world; it is, as it were, fixed; for fixed, as it were, is this (earth-)world.</description>

      <description>01 He puts the heads of the victims in (the fire-pan),&amp;ndash;the heads of the victims being animals (or cattle), it is animals he thus puts thereon. He puts them in the fire-pan;&amp;ndash;the pan being these worlds, and the heads of the victims being beasts, he thus puts animals in these worlds; whence there are animals in these worlds.
02 And as to why (he puts the heads) in the fire-pan;&amp;ndash;the fire-pan being a womb, and the heads of the victims being animals, he thus establishes the animals in the womb: hence animals, though being eaten and cooked, do not diminish, for he establishes them in the womb.</description>
