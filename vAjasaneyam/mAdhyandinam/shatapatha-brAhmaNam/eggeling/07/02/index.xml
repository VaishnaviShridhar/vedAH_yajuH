      <description>01 He then prepares the Prāyaṇīya 1 (opening sacrifice). With the Havishkr̥t of that (oblation) he releases (the Sacrificer&amp;rsquo;s) speech 2. Having released his speech, he throws away the grass-bush (stambayajus 3). Having thrown away the grass-bush, and drawn the first line of enclosure 4, and the lines (across the mahā-vedi), he says, &amp;lsquo;Throw thrice!&amp;rsquo; and the Āgnīdhra throws thrice (the wooden sword) 5. 02 Having returned (to the offering, or hall-door fire) he proceeds with the opening sacrifice.</description>

      <description>01 They now take the Nirr̥ti (bricks) from there. For, having built the Gārhapatya, the gods then ascended it,&amp;ndash;the Gārhapatya being this (earth-) world, it is this world they ascended after completing it. They saw nothing but darkness not to be seen through. 02 They said, &amp;lsquo;Think ye upon this, how we may dispel that darkness, evil!&amp;rsquo; They said, &amp;lsquo;Meditate ye (cetay)!&amp;rsquo;&amp;ndash;whereby indeed they said, &amp;lsquo;Seek ye to build an altar (kitim)!</description>

      <description>01 He then places a bunch of darbha (kuśa) grass (poa cynosuroides) on (the middle of the altar-site); for the gods then placed plants thereon, and in like manner does the Sacrificer now place plants thereon. 02 And, again, why he places a bunch of grass thereon;&amp;ndash;when he (Agni) is built up, he is born, and he is born here for all (kinds of) food; but these darbha plants (contain) both kinds of food, for they are both water and plants.</description>

      <description>01 He then pours out jarfuls of water,&amp;ndash;for the gods then said, &amp;lsquo;Meditate ye (cetay)!&amp;rsquo; whereby they doubtless meant to say, &amp;lsquo;Seek ye a layer (citim)!&amp;rsquo; Whilst meditating they saw the rain to be a (suitable) layer, and put it on that (altar-site); and in like manner does this (Sacrificer) now put it thereon. 02 Jarfuls of water are (poured out); for rain is water: it is rain he thereby bestows on it.</description>
